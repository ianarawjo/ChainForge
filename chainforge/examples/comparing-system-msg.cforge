          "```racket\n(define (substring str start end)\n  (substring str start end))\n```\n\nThe `substring` function takes three arguments, where `str` is the string you want to extract a substring from, `start` is the starting index of the substring, and `end` is the ending index of the substring. The `substring` function returns the substring starting from index `start` up to but not including index `end`.",

This function uses the built-in `substring` procedure provided by Racket that extracts a substring of a given string.",
          "```racket\n(define (substring str start end)\n  (substring str start (+ end 1)))\n```\n\nThis function takes in a string `str`, a start index `start`, and an end index `end`. It returns the substring of `str` starting from index `start` up to and including index `end`. The `substring` function in Racket requires the end index to be one more than the actual desired end index, hence the need to add 1 when passing `end` to the `substring` function."
