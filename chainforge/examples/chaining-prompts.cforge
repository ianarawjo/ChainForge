She used a paper filter to brew coffee, which was a revolutionary idea at the time and is still commonly used today. Prior to her invention, coffee was typically made by simply boiling water and coffee grounds together and then straining the mixture to remove the grounds.",
            "The modern coffee maker was invented by Melitta Bentz in 1908. She was a German housewife who was not satisfied with the coffee that was made in coffee bags and pots. She experimented with different materials and finally found that a piece of blotting paper from her son's school notebook, placed in a metal cup perforated with small holes, was the perfect filter. She patented the design and started a company, which still exists today."
