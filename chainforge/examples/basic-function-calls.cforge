They typically occur in areas with unstable atmospheric conditions, where there is a significant amount of moisture and atmospheric instability. When warm air rises, it cools and condenses, forming cumulus clouds. As the upward movement continues, the clouds grow taller and larger, eventually reaching levels where ice crystals and water droplets coexist. The collisions between these particles within the cloud create an electrical charge. When the charge imbalance becomes significant, it is discharged in the form of lightning, which is followed by the characteristic sound of thunder. Thunderstorms can also be influenced by other factors such as atmospheric pressure and wind patterns.",
