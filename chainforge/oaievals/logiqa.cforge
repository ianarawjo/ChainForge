This shows that their taste buds are less sensitive to sweetness. The results also show that people who are fatter tend to choose sweeter foods subconsciously. This suggests that eating too much sugar may form a vicious circle, that is, eating sugar regularly will lead to a decrease in the sensitivity of taste buds to sweetness, and a decrease in satisfaction caused by eating the same amount of sugar, which will subconsciously ask for more sugar. The result is that eating too much sugar leads to obesity.Question: Which of the following options does not support the above argument?\nA.

The research report points out that the snake is 50 centimeters long. On the surface, it has only one foot, about 2 centimeters long. The other foot of the real foot snake was found by X-ray scanning. The reason why this foot is not easy to detect is that it was alienated in the rock, with only four bones in its ankle and no toes, indicating that the feet of true-footed snakes had deteriorated at that time.Question: Which of the followings, if true, can best support the views of the above scholars?\nA.

Generally speaking, taking Wuyishan-Nanling as the boundary, the consanguinity of Chinese surnames is obviously divided into two branches: the north and the south.The consanguinity of the Han nationality between the two places is quite different, even greater than that between the Han nationality in the north and south and the local ethnic minorities. This shows that with the expansion of the population, the Han nationality continued to go south and crossed the Yangtze River into Huguang more than 2000 years ago, and finally crossed the strait to Hainan Island. During this process, the Han people who moved south continued to integrate with many ethnic minorities who spoke Dong-Tai, South Asian and Miao languages, thus diluting the consanguinity of the Han nationality in the north.Question: Which of the followings, if true, can best refute the above argument?\nA.

This unique light emitted by atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons released by it will also become higher, so the frequency of release and absorption will be blue-shifted. On the contrary, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will redshift. Astronomical observations have found that most galaxies have redshift, and the farther away the galaxies are from Earth, the greater the redshift. Based on this, many scientists believe that the universe must be expanding.Question: Which of the followings, if true, can best refute the views of the above scientists?\nA.

This suggests that eating too much sugar may form a vicious circle, that is, eating sugar regularly will lead to a decrease in the sensitivity of taste buds to sweetness, and a decrease in satisfaction caused by eating the same amount of sugar, which will subconsciously ask for more sugar. The result is that eating too much sugar leads to obesity.Question: Which of the following options does not support the above argument?\nA.

This unique light emitted by atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons released by it will also become higher, so the frequency of release and absorption will be blue-shifted. On the contrary, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will redshift. Astronomical observations have found that most galaxies have redshift, and the farther away the galaxies are from Earth, the greater the redshift. Based on this, many scientists believe that the universe must be expanding.Question: Which of the followings, if true, can best refute the views of the above scientists?\nA.
