To determine whether there is any foundation to these claims, a researcher uses a speed camera to measure the speeds of 400 drivers on an A-road, the morning before the programme is transmitted. He follows this procedure again, the morning afterwards. Each car is photographed, so that the experimenter can select only those drivers who travelled that route on both occasions, and hence whose speeds were measured twice. The experimenter subtracts each driver's first speed reading from their second, to get a \"difference score\": a positive score means a driver drove faster on the second occasion, and a negative score means they drove more slowly. The selected drivers were then contacted and asked whether or not they had watched \"Top Gear\" that week. Which test would you use to see whether drivers who watched \"Top Gear\" drove faster the following morning than drivers who did not watch it?'

She then releases them back into the wild and follows them for a fortnight, recording how many females each one mates with.
