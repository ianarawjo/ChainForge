The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes.

The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.\n\nThe patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.\n\nHis blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nNeck\n\u2022 General Examination: I do feel a little large thyroid that is not tender.

His blood pressure today was still elevated.\n\nChest pain and hypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hi , roger . how are you ?\n[patient] hey . good to see you .\n[doctor] good to see you . are you ready to get started ?\n[patient] yes , i am .\n[doctor] roger is a 62 year old male here for emergency room follow-up for some chest pain . so , roger , i heard you went to the er for some chest discomfort .\n[patient] yeah . we were doing a bunch of yard work and it was really hot over the weekend and i was short of breath and i felt a little chest pain for probably about an hour or so . so , i got a little nervous about that .\n[doctor] okay . and had you ever had that before ?\n[patient] no , i never have , actually .\n[doctor] okay . and-\n[patient] whose mic is on ?

I will also place him on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day.\n\nStatus post basal cell carcinoma removal.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well and the removal site is well-healed.

to get started ?\n[patient] yes , i am .\n[doctor] louis is a 58-year-old male here for follow up from an emergency room visit . so , louis , what happened ?\n[patient] yeah . i was playing tennis on saturday . it was really , really hot that day , very humid . and about after about a half an hour i was very short of breath , i was struggling breathing . i thought i was having a heart attack , got really nervous . so , my wife took me to the er and , uh , everything checked out , but i was just very upset about it .\n[doctor] okay . all right . and how have you been feeling since that time ?\n[patient] uh , foof , probably , probably about six hours after we got home , i felt very light-head and very dizzy and then , sunday , i felt fine . i just thought it was worth checking up with you though .\n[doctor] okay . and have you been taking all of your meds for your heart failure ?\n[patient] i have . i have . i've been , uh , very diligent with it . and , uh , i'm in touch with the doctor and so far , so good , other than this episode on saturday .\n[doctor] okay . and , and you're watching your diet , you're avoiding salt . have you had anything salty ?\n[patient] i cheat every now and then . you know , i try and stay away from the junk food and the salty foods . but , for the most part , i've been doing a good job of that .\n[doctor] okay . all right . um , and i know that they removed a cataract from your eye-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . a couple of , like couple months ago . that's been fine ?\n[patient] that was three months ago , thursday , and everything's been fine ever since .\n[doctor] okay . so , no vision problems .\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . and you had a skin cancer removed about five months ago as well . you've had a lot going on .\n[patient] yeah . it's been a really busy year . an- and again , so far , so good . that healed up nicely , no problems ever since .\n[doctor] okay . all right . um , so , why do n't we go ahead and we'll do a quick physical-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . exam . hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . so , here , your blood pressure is a little high .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] um , so , you know , i did see a report in the emergency room that your blood pressure was high there as well .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] so , we'll have to just kind of talk about that . uh , but let's go ahead and we'll examine you .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] okay ?\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . so , you know , looking at you , your neck is very supple . i do n't appreciate any fibular venous distention . your heart is a regular rate and rhythm , no murmur . your lungs have some fine crackles in them , bilaterally . and you have trace lower extremity edema in both legs . so , what that means , essentially , is that you may have some extra fluid on board , um , from eating salty foods-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . along with this history of your congestive heart failure . but , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the ecg . so , this is , uh , a s- a stable ecg for you . this basically shows that you have some left ventricular hypertrophy which caused your congestive heart failure . um , let's go ahead and review your echocardiogram . hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , in reviewing the results of your echocardiogram , it shows that your pumping function of your heart is a little low , uh , but it's stable . and , you know , i think that we know this and we have you on the appropriate-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] medication therapy . and then , i just wan na be reminded about , um , the results of your skin biopsy . hey , dragon , show me the skin biopsy results . okay . and in reviewing the pathology report for your skin cancer-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . you know , it looks like they got all of that and everything's fine .\n[patient] yep .\n[doctor] so , you know , my impression of you at this time , for the shortness of breath that you had in the emergency department , i think it was an exacerbation of your heart failure . and you probably had some , what we call , dietary indiscretion , you ate some salty food which made you retain some fluid .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] so , for that , i'm going to prescribe you , you know , an extra dose of lasix 80 milligrams , once a day . and , um , we're going to , uh , put you on some carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . okay ?\n[patient] okay . perfect .\n[doctor] um , and i think from a , a cataract surgery standpoint and your skin cancer removal , everything seems to be fine and you're doing well , so i do n't think we need to adjust any of those medications .\n[patient] good to hear .\n[doctor] okay ? hey , dragon , order lasix 80 milligrams , once a day . hey , dragon , order carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . okay . and the nurse will come in and she'll see you soon . okay ?\n[patient] great .\n[doctor] hey , dragon , finalize the note ."}, {"id": "ef6c73d6892648ac942de56bce272c98", "document": "Patient ID: virtassist-D2N015-VA040\nPatient Name: Rachel nan\nAge: 48.0\nGender: female\nChief Complaint:

The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.\n\nVitamin D deficiency\nThe patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.\n\nHirsutism\nHer androgen levels were normal.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nShe will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .\n[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?\n[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?\n[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .\n[patient] yes , i did .\n[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?\n[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .\n[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?\n[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .\n[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .\n[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?\n[doctor] yep , right here .\n[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .\n[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .\n[patient] that would be great .\n[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .\n[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .\n[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .\n[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?\n[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .\n[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .\n[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?\n[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .\n[doctor] okay , good .\n[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?\n[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?\n[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .\n[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...\n[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .\n[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .\n[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .\n[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .\n[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .\n[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .\n[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .\n[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .\n[patient] okay , thank you . got it .\n[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?\n[patient] no , not that i know of .\n[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] all right .\n[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .\n[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?\n[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .\n[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .\n[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .\n[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?\n[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .\n[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .\n[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .\n[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , sounds good .\n[patient] great .\n[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .\n[patient] okay , i will do that .\n[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .\n[patient] okay , that's okay .\n[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .\n[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .\n[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .\n[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .\n[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .\n[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .\n[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .\n[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .\n[doctor] yeah , this is much better .\n[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .\n[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .\n[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?\n[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .\n[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .\n[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .\n[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?\n[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .\n[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?\n[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] does that make sense ?\n[patient] yes , it does .\n[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .\n[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?\n[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .\n[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .\n[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .\n[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .\n[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .\n[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .\n[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .\n[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .\n[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .\n[patient] okay , will do .\n[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .\n[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .\n[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?\n[patient] yes , that sounds great .\n[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .\n[patient] okay , that would be great .\n[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .\n[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .\n[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .\n[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .\n[doctor] you're welcome .\n[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks ."}, {"id": "56c6aaa6dbc741ada3cd98bf83003d04", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N022-VS029\nPatient Name: philip gutierrez\nAge: 50.0\nGender: male \nChief Complaint: right index finger hyperextension \nSecondary Complaints: none\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight index finger hyperextension injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.\n\nIn summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the \"FDS tendon.\"\n\nThe patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.\n\nThe patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.\n\nMs. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployed as x-ray technician.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nMethylprednisolone causes itching.\nDexamethasone causes palpitations.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.\n\u2022 Endocrine: Denies diabetes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nVery pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.\n\nNeurological\nGrossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.\n\nCardiovascular\nRegular rate and rhythm.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nExam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.\n\nMRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.\n\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.\n\nPLAN\n\nThe patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.\n\nTreatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.\n\nThe patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nRight index trigger finger injection.\nThe patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nOccupational therapy as prescribed.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , \" fds tendon , \" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .\n[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .\n[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?\n[patient] i'm good , how about you ?\n[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?\n[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .\n[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?\n[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .\n[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?\n[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .\n[doctor] yeah , i see that .\n[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .\n[doctor] what do you do for a living ?\n[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .\n[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?\n[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .\n[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?\n[patient] uh , that's correct .\n[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .\n[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?\n[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .\n[doctor] all right , how about here ?\n[patient] um , there , it's not .\n[doctor] okay , not as bad ?\n[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .\n[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .\n[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .\n[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?\n[patient] ow , .\n[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .\n[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .\n[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .\n[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .\n[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .\n[patient] so the good one is good ?\n[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .\n[patient] okay , all right .\n[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .\n[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .\n[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .\n[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .\n[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .\n[patient] perfect .\n[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .\n[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .\n[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .\n[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...\n[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?\n[patient] uh , not at the moment .\n[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .\n[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?\n[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no

59.0\nGender: male\nChief Complaint: hypogonadism \nSecondary Complaints: gynecomastia\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHypogonadism.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient\u2019s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.\n\nThe patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.\n\nCurrently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.\n\nMr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life \"together.\" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHIV\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nUtilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.\nActively trying to get his life together.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nCialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.\nFinasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.\nTestosterone cypionate 140 mg.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPSA 0.6 ng/mL.\nTriglycerides 145 mg/dL.\nTotal testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Hypogonadism.\n\nPLAN\n\nI recommend maintaining current management. The patient\u2019s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it\u2019s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.\n\nI provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .\n[doctor] hey , how are you today ?\n[patient] all right , how have you been ?\n[doctor] i'm good .\n[patient] good , good .\n[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .\n[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .\n[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .\n[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .\n[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?\n[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .\n[doctor] that's great .\n[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .\n[doctor] okay , well that's good .\n[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .\n[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .\n[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .\n[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] in and out .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .\n[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .\n[doctor] sure .\n[patient] look at this .\n[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?\n[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .\n[doctor] right .\n[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .\n[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .\n[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .\n[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .\n[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .\n[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .\n[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .\n[doctor] absolutely .\n[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .\n[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .\n[patient] stable .\n[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .\n[patient] yeah . , is it ?\n[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .\n[patient] nice , that's good news .\n[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .\n[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?\n[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .\n[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .\n[doctor] well , your levels are high .\n[patient] are they right now ?\n[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .\n[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .\n[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?\n[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .\n[doctor] all right .\n[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .\n[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .\n[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .\n[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .\n[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .\n[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .\n[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .\n[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] make sense ?\n[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .\n[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?\n[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .\n[doctor] for all of them ?\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .\n[patient] okay , thank you ."}, {"id": "f1120a94cfb646bc848e0ca663346e0c", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N024-VS034\nPatient Name: pamela cook\nAge: 36.0\nGender: female \nChief Complaint: follow up on bilateral reduction mammoplasty \nSecondary Complaints: scar tissue\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow up bilateral reduction mammoplasty.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nPamela Cook is a 36-year-old female who is returning for a postoperative visit.

The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.\n\nI last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.\n\nThe patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.\n\nShe is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.\n\nRegarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original \"stomach medication\".\n\nThe patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nChronic Congestive Heart Failure.\nIron deficiency Anemia.\n\nMedications\nPrilosec.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo family history of colon cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nTorsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.\nLisinopril 10 mg daily.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMagnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.\n03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.\n\u2022 Preop examination.\n\u2022 Diabetes mellitus.\n\u2022 Colonoscopy\n\nPLAN\n\nChronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.\nShe had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.\n\nPreop examination.\nShe is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.\n\nDiabetes mellitus.\nA1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.\n\nColonoscopy.\nThe patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.\n\nThe patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nComplete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .\n[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?\n[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .\n[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .\n[patient] yeah , that would not be good .\n[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .\n[patient] yeah , that's right .\n[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .\n[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .\n[doctor] well that's great .\n[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .\n[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?\n[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .\n[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .\n[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .\n[doctor] okay good .\n[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .\n[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?\n[patient] uh yes , everything is good .\n[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?\n[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .\n[doctor] great .\n[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .\n[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?\n[patient] uh yeah , that's right .\n[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .\n[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .\n[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .\n[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?\n[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .\n[patient] all righty .\n[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .\n[patient] all righty that sounds good .\n[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .\n[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .\n[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .\n[doctor] use my general physical exam template .\n[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .\n[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .\n[patient] all righty .\n[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .\n[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .\n[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .\n[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .\n[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .\n[patient] okay , i'll put that down .\n[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .\n[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .\n[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?\n[patient] yeah , i have both .\n[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .\n[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?\n[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .\n[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .\n[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .\n[patient] great , thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .\n[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .\n[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .\n[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks ."}, {"id": "2d6b08fc388940c895deaf151382340f", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N026-VS032\nPatient Name: donald clark\nAge: nan\nGender: male \nChief Complaint: left arm pain \nSecondary Complaints: hand pain \n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft arm pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nHe reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago.

She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.\n\nThe pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.\n\nMr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating \u201cit rarely works\u201d, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPeripheral neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nGabapentin tablet.\nPrednisone tablet.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.\n\nNeurologic\nUpper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's\nGait: Not assessed today.\n\nStrength\nUpper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.\nSensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nCervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.\nImpression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy\n\u2022 Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation\n\nPLAN\n\nI suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.\n\nThis plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nContinue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?\n[patient] good morning .\n[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .\n[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .\n[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?\n[patient] that's correct .\n[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?\n[patient] well , right now the hand is .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .\n[doctor] okay , that's good .\n[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .\n[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .\n[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .\n[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .\n[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .\n[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?\n[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .\n[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?\n[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .\n[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?\n[patient] uh , yes .\n[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .\n[doctor] really ?\n[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .\n[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?\n[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .\n[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?\n[patient] uh , yep .\n[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?\n[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .\n[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?\n[patient] yeah , just a little strain .\n[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?\n[patient] uh , yes .\n[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .\n[patient] i see .\n[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?\n[patient] i think that sounds good to me .\n[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .\n[patient] uh , no , i do n't .\n[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?\n[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .\n[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?\n[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .\n[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .\n[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .\n[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?\n[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .\n[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .\n[patient] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .\n[patient] all right . is the mri today ?\n[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] all right . well , it was nice meeting you , my friend .\n[patient] you as well . thank you .\n[doctor] physical exam , elderly white gentleman presents in a wheelchair . no apparent distress . per the template , down through neuro- neurologic . one plus bilateral biceps . triceps brachioradialis . reflexes bilateral all negative . follow up and take out the lower extremities . gait not assessed today . strength and sensation is per the template . uh , upper and lower extremities . musculoskeletal , he is non-tender over his cervical spine . he does have mildly restricted cervical exte- extension . right and left lateral rotation which is symmetric , which gives him mild lateral neck pain but no radi- radicular pain . spurling's maneuver is benign .\n[doctor] paragraph , diagnostics . cervical x-ray 6421 . cervical x-ray reveals significant disc degeneration at c56 , and to a lower extent c45 and c34 . significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy c67 and c7-t1 is difficult to visualize in the current x-rays .\n[doctor] paragraph , impression . number one , left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radicularopathy . possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy . number two , neck pain in the setting of arthritis disc degeneration .\n[doctor] paragraph , plan . i suspect that this is a flare of cervical radicularopathy . i'm going to set him up for a cervical mri , and we'll tentatively plan for a left c7-t1 epidural afterwards , although the exact location will be pending the mri results . he'll continue his home exercise program as well as twice a day gabapentin . we'll follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief . he denies any blood thinners ."}, {"id": "53cf98618b064757a50cb4f1553d6f98", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N027-VS016\nPatient Name: eugene walker\nAge: 61.0\nGender: male \nChief Complaint: follow up visit of chronic medical conditions\nSecondary Complaints: fatigue; pursed lips breathing; nodule on epididymis \n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRoutine follow up of chronic medical conditions.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Eugene Walker is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.\n\nToday, the patient reports feeling more fatigued as of late. He notes that he usually rides his bike for about 20 to 30 miles and by the end of his ride he is tired enough that he will immediately fall asleep. The patient adds that he can fall asleep easily and gets about 6 or 7 hours of sleep per night. He believes he snores a bit but denies any signs of apnea.\n\nOf note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 01/22/2013. As he is now 8 years post-op, he has requested an echocardiogram from Dr. Lewis to review how he is doing currently. His last stress test was performed on 09/09/2019.\n\nMr. Walker reports that his wife and friends have told him that he has pursed lips when he walks.

male \nChief Complaint: abdominal pain; diarrhea\nSecondary Complaints: hepatomegaly\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAbdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nPatrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.\n\nMr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a \u201cnagging feeling\u201d when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.\n\nIn addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.\n\nThe patient\u2019s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient\u2019s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.\n\nThe patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\nLungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\nNo murmurs, gallops, or rubs.\n\nAbdomen\nNormoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.\nImpression: Normal CT of abdomen.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Constipation\n\u2022 Mild hepatomegaly\n\nPLAN\n\nPatrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago.

uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea .\n[patient] right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here .\n[doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen , just below the belly button ?\n[patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .\n[doctor] i saw that .\n[patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .\n[doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal .\n[patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .\n[doctor] is the pain there all the time ?\n[patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .\n[doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ?\n[patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .\n[doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ?\n[patient] they were normal .\n[doctor] uh , okay . so any blood in your stool ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ?\n[patient] probably more constipation .\n[doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ?\n[patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .\n[doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ?\n[patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .\n[doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ?\n[patient] yeah , it gets a little better .\n[doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ?\n[patient] none of that .\n[doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?\n[patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .\n[doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ?\n[patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .\n[doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ?\n[patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .\n[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?\n[patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .\n[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ?\n[patient] i've never had any surgery .\n[doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ?\n[patient] yup .\n[doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ?\n[patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .\n[doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .\n[patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?\n[doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .\n[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .\n[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?\n[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .\n[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?\n[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .\n[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?\n[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .\n[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?\n[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .\n[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?\n[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .\n[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?\n[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .\n[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .\n[patient] what would cause that ?\n[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .\n[patient] that's good .\n[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .\n[patient] what's that ?\n[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .\n[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?\n[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .\n[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?\n[doctor] correct .\n[patient] so what does that mean ?\n[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .\n[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?\n[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .\n[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?\n[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .\n[patient] so what do i need to do ?\n[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .\n[patient] okay . and then what ?\n[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .\n[patient] which medications ?\n[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?\n[patient] about 18 months .\n[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .\n[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?\n[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .\n[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .\n[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .\n[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?\n[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .\n[patient] okay . and then what happens ?\n[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .\n[patient] and when should i see you again ?\n[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .\n[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?\n[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .\n[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .\n[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .\n[patient] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .\n[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .\n[doctor] thank you , mr. allen ."}, {"id": "841420f01e1642c7968a9078644482c7", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N029-VS028\nPatient Name: sophia jackson\nAge: 57.0\nGender: female \nChief Complaint: melanoma \nSecondary Complaints: none\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nMelanoma.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSophia Jackson is a very pleasant 57-year-old female who presents for a surgical consult for melanoma of the right inferior back. She was referred by her dermatologist who biopsied the 0.7 mm lesion on 04/10 and diagnosed the melanoma. The lesion was initially noticed by the patient\u2019s mother when she was visiting her last month. Mrs. Jackson denies a personal history of atypical nevi and reports that she has annual mole checks by her primary care provider at her physicals. She has never seen a dermatologist prior to last month. There is a family history of melanoma in her mother and maternal aunt. The patient reports that she has been in her usual state of health with no unintentional weight changes, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nNone reported.\n\nSurgical\nCholecystectomy.\nAppendectomy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient owns an auto repair shop.\nCurrent smoker since teens. Actively trying to quit.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMother: melanoma.\nMaternal aunt: melanoma.\nMaternal grandfather: pancreatic cancer.\nNo family history of breast or ovarian cancers.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nNone.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nAugmentin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nHematologic/lymphatics: No axillary, cervical, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. There is a soft lymph node in the right groin. Nontender.\nSkin: On the right inferior back there is a 1 cm shave biopsy site including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation. There\u2019s no intrinsic or satellite lesions. No other suspicious moles.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPathology Report.\n\nPathology: Shave biopsy of right inferior back malignant melanoma, invasive, superficial spreading.\nHistology: Superficial spreading.\nClark level: 4.\nBreslow thickness: 0.7 mm.\nRadial growth phase: present.\nVertical growth phase: not identified.\nMitotic figures: less than 1 mm2.\nUlceration: not identified.\nRegression: not identified.\nLymphatic invasion: not identified.\nPerineural invasion: not identified.\nMicroscopic satellitosis: not identified.\nInfiltrating lymphocytes: breast.\nMelanocytic nevus: not identified.\nPredominant cytology: epithelioid.\nPeripheral margin: positive.\nDeep margin: Negative.\nStage: 1.\n\nI reviewed the dermatologist\u2019s photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central amelanotic component and irregular border.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nThe patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma. The biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma. On examination today, there is a right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency. I recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient is a candidate for a wide local excision with a 1-2 cm margin. Primary closure should be possible, but skin graft closure may be needed. The relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed. The need for follow up according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines was reviewed. We also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and the ABCDE\u2019s of mole surveillance. After discussing the procedure, risks, expected outcomes and possible complications, questions were answered, and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .\n[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .\n[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .\n[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?\n[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .\n[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?\n[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .\n[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?\n[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .\n[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?\n[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .\n[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?\n[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .\n[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?\n[patient] mother's .\n[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?\n[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .\n[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\n[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?\n[patient] i own an auto repair shop .\n[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?\n[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .\n[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?\n[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .\n[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?\n[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .\n[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?\n[patient] okay , that's fine .\n[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .\n[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .\n[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?\n[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .\n[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .\n[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .\n[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .\n[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .\n[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .\n[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?\n[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .\n[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .\n[patient] thank you , nice to meet you as well .\n[doctor] please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading .

with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.\n\nHer last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.\n\nMrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating \u201cit was brutal\u201d and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.\n\nThe patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite.

'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .\n[patient] i did .\n[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .\n[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .\n[doctor] hmm , okay .\n[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .\n[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .\n[patient] yeah , i do n't know .\n[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .\n[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .\n[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .\n[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .\n[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .\n[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .\n[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] have you lost weight ?\n[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , \" what is going on ? \"\n[doctor] all right .\n[patient] and now i am feeling better .\n[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .\n[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .\n[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?\n[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .\n[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .\n[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .\n[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .\n[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .\n[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?\n[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .\n[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .\n[patient] yeah , i agree .\n[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .\n[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .\n[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?\n[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .\n[doctor] okay , right here ?\n[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .\n[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?\n[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .\n[patient] good .\n[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .\n[patient] thank you .\n[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .\n[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?\n[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .\n[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .\n[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] so those are all good things .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .\n[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .\n[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .\n[patient] yeah , i agree there .\n[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .\n[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .\n[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .\n[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .\n[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?\n[patient] no , i think i'm all set .\n[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .\n[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .\n[doctor] all right ."}, {"id": "51da7a34a5c34c1d938de7e270dfa203", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N031-VS027\nPatient Name: sophia brown\nAge: 75.0\nGender: female \nChief Complaint: right ductal carcinoma in situ\nSecondary Complaints: none\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHistory of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.\n\nThe patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o\u2019clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.\n\nMrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe patient\u2019s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.\n\nHer cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypercholesterolemia.\nStage 0 ER/PR-positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, status post lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy.\n\nSurgical\nRight lumpectomy, lymphadenectomy x5, 01/20/2020.\nBilateral tubal ligation.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nAlcohol: Socially.

Patient has sought care for these complaints. She reports that she was told the back pain and joint pain (knee) are age-related. She is being followed for the high cholesterol by her primary care provider.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nThe ECOG performance status today is grade 0.\nBreast: There are no palpable masses; however, there is some skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nStage 0 ER/PR-positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast.\nThe patient is status post lumpectomy with removal of 5 lymph nodes which were benign. She also underwent adjuvant radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy. Today\u2019s clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrent disease or other malignancy.

doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .\n[patient] you as well .\n[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?\n[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .\n[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?\n[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .\n[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?\n[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .\n[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .\n[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .\n[doctor] yep , definitely .\n[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .\n[patient] yes . unfortunately .\n[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !\n[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .\n[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?\n[patient] yes . fingers crossed .\n[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?\n[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .\n[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?\n[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .\n[doctor] okay . do you have children ?\n[patient] i do . i have five .\n[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .\n[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .\n[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .\n[patient] it is .\n[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?\n[patient] really , i did not .\n[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?\n[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .\n[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .\n[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .\n[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?\n[patient] that's correct .\n[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?\n[patient] yes , and that's all .\n[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?\n[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .\n[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?\n[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .\n[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?\n[patient] none .\n[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?\n[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .\n[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?\n[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .\n[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?\n[patient] nope , just penicillin .\n[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .\n[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .\n[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .\n[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?\n[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .\n[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .\n[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .\n[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?\n[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !\n[patient] you as well ."}, {"id": "4730ea50377d4cc79a5c3be34f49aab0", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N032-VS031\nPatient Name: michelle king\nAge: 56.0\nGender: female \nChief

The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.\n\nThe patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nAll vital signs are within the normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] alright you can go ahead\n[patient] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so\n[doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better\n[patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started\n[doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit\n[patient] hmmm\n[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of\n[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that\n[doctor] no nothing at all\n[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that\n[doctor] no\n[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before\n[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help\n[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck\n[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain\n[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder\n[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere\n[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go\n[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well\n[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it\n[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all\n[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers\n[doctor] no numbness or tingling\n[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] acromioclavicular joints\n[doctor] yeah yeah\n[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch\n[doctor] yes thank you yep\n[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are\n[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder\n[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before\n[doctor] i have n't\n[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan\n[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away\n[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days\n[doctor] okay alright thank you\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] okay bye"}, {"id":

help\n[patient] okay i'll i'll give that a try anything that will help\n[doctor] yeah okay well that's good to hear so now have you bought a blood pressure cuff to have at home now\n[patient] yes i already had one but i very failed if i ever used it\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but\n[doctor] got it\n[patient] i'll i'll try to use it everyday now\n[doctor] okay and you might even just keep a log of

He reports consuming 1 to 2 beers on weekends.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left wrist and hand pain. Denies right hand pain.\nNeurological: Reports numbness in bilateral hands and fingers, and left hand weakness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.\nMSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nBilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.\n\nThe patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey george how are you today i understand you're here for some numbness and tingling in your fingers and some pain in your wrist\n[patient] right my right wrist and hand has been bothering me probably for a few months now with pain and numbness\n[doctor] okay and you said that's been ongoing for several months do you know what caused this type of pain or is it just something that started slowly or\n[patient] it just kinda started on it's own it i notice it mostly at night\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] sometimes it will i'll wake up and my hands asleep and i got ta shake it out\n[doctor] shake it out and okay\n[patient] and then some\n[doctor] what kind of work do you do\n[patient] i do yard work\n[doctor] yard work\n[patient] landscaping landscaping\n[doctor] landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements\n[patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out\n[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers\n[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger\n[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no\n[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too\n[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand\n[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left\n[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption\n[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends\n[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that\n[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean\n[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed\n[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand\n[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or\n[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it\n[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right\n[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side\n[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that\n[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips\n[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side\n[patient] yeah same thing\n[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time\n[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate\n[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you\n[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start\n[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do\n[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep\n[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some\n[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore\n[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this\n[patient] no i think it's all clear i appreciate it\n[doctor] okay take care and i'll look forward to see you in two weeks\n[patient] very good appreciate your time"}, {"id": "8edd6747915c429481ccf6995d4eddc7", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N037-ACI073\nPatient Name: dylan

pain, right worse than left.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.\n\nThe patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.\n\nHe is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Pulses are equal in all extremities.\nNEURO: Sensation is normal to light touch distally.\nMSK: \nExamination of the right elbow: Limited range of motion with extension with pain.

I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey dylan what's going on so i lift quite a bit of weights i try to stay in shape as much as i can i'm not like normal people i lift heavy weights and my elbow is extremely sore which elbow is it\n[patient] actually it's both my elbows but my right elbow is hurting me the most\n[doctor] okay and you said you lift a lot of weights\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] did you play any sports when you were younger\n[patient] no anything you can think of primarily it was basketball baseball and football\n[doctor] okay and did your elbows hurt at that time or is this a a new injury\n[patient] it's new\n[doctor] when did it start\n[patient] probably year and a half ago\n[doctor] okay on both elbows about a year and a half ago\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain\n[patient] ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams three times a day\n[doctor] okay and does anything make it better or

it this way up does it hurt it's your left does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] how about this\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so pain with both flexion and extension\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright how about the outside\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your

supination no pain with pronation\n[patient] correct\n[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is\n[patient] is that golfer's elbow\n[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot\n[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time\n[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow\n[patient] well i have n't been pitching either\n[doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to

since we're a private practice\n[patient] thank god\n[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before\n[patient] no please tell me remind me\n[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow\n[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow\n[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow\n[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then\n[doctor] no\n[patient] not at all\n[doctor] what is it\n[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] that it activates the healing\n[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is\n[patient] interesting cool\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] maybe i have heard about that\n[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this\n[patient] i'm excited\n[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that\n[patient] wow i did n't even say that\n[doctor] i read it in your chart\n[patient] man you doctors are good\n[doctor] yeah anything else

lab work for hep c so how're you doing today\n[doctor] i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive\n[patient] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c\n[doctor] no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised\n[patient] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners\n[doctor] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now\n[patient] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot\n[doctor] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to\n[patient] okay and have you ever smoked before\n[doctor] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too\n[patient] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise\n[patient] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family\n[doctor] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate\n[patient] regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly\n[doctor] hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one\n[patient] splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound\n[doctor] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them\n[patient] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay\n[doctor] okay that sounds good\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] my nurse will be in with those those orders\n[doctor] alright thank you\n[patient] alright thanks\n[doctor] bye"}, {"id": "2a98a9adef0d494791fd4b32cac618cc", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N039-ACI070\nPatient Name: virginia nan\nAge:

ninety\n[doctor] wow\n[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again\n[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure

to cvs at all\n[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore\n[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so\n[patient] did they\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] that's good to know\n[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally\n[patient] alright do you want the honest answer\n[doctor] well yeah that would be better\n[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better\n[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches\n[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis\n[doctor] okay what about chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] shortness of breath\n[patient] no shortness of breath\n[doctor] even with exertion\n[patient] even with exertion\n[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed\n[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no\n[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure\n[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease\n[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on\n[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on\n[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve\n[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday\n[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for\n[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends\n[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me\n[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control\n[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] okay take care i'll talk to you later\n[patient] okay alright bye"}, {"id": "ad4869a5c1f84e0db7187aa853d62cd0", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N040-ACI037\nPatient Name: Carolyn nan\nAge: 34.0\nGender:

-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type two who is here today with a headache so hi there carolyn it's nice to see you again listen i'm sorry you're having headaches well let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this app that's gon na help me focus on you more would that be okay with you\n[patient] yes that's okay\n[doctor] okay great thanks so carolyn tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having\n[patient] my headache started about a week ago it's feeling like a dull pain in the back of my head i have flushing in my ears they get really red and hot and sometimes i just feel a little bit dizzy when i get these headaches but i've taken tylenol and advil and it's not really going away it just keeps coming back\n[doctor] okay and alright and so this started about a week ago has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what\n[patient] it comes and goes i it it's relieved when i take my tylenol or advil but then it comes right back\n[doctor] hmmm okay and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse\n[patient] it's definitely worse in the evening\n[doctor] okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else\n[patient] yes no just in the back of my head\n[doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what\n[patient] i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring\n[doctor] okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache\n[patient] no no fever\n[doctor] okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you had headaches like this before\n[patient] i have\n[doctor] okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say\n[patient] no it's not\n[doctor] okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what\n[patient] i have n't been checking my blood sugars\n[doctor] really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise\n[patient] i have not been eating well because i've been stressed over the last week but i have n't been exercising for maybe the past week but generally i've been doing better\n[doctor] okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what\n[patient] yes it has\n[doctor] okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being\n[patient] not lately\n[doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it\n[patient] i did\n[doctor] yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or\n[patient] i am\n[doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful\n[patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to\n[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me\n[patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better\n[doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you\n[patient] no no i think it's just stress\n[doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] sure"}, {"id": "a899be67c9054b6cb8096a71f300fb8b", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N041-ACI059\nPatient Name: teresa nan\nAge: nan\nGender: female\nChief

NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight ankle pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nCarolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.\n\nThe patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.\n\nOf note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.\nNeurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nNormal\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGAIT: antalgic gait\nCV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.\nNEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.\nMSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] good morning carolyn how are you\n[patient] i'm doing alright other than this ankle pain i've been having\n[doctor] so i see here that you hurt your right ankle can you tell me what happened\n[patient] yeah so yesterday i was going to take out the trash and it was quite icy i thought i was doing okay job and i just slipped and and fell and i'm pretty sure i heard a pop\n[doctor] okay and you said this happened yesterday correct\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay and have you been able to walk on it at all\n[patient] no i was so initially when i first fell i was unable to walk at on it at all i had a friend that was visiting and so she heard me fall so she helped me inside now today i have been able to put a little bit more weight on it but i'm still limping\n[doctor] okay and then what have you been doing for your foot or ankle pain since that happened\n[patient] so i like iced it last night and kept it elevated and i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning before coming in today\n[doctor] okay and can you rate your pain for me\n[patient] i would say right now it's like a four out of ten\n[doctor] okay and does the ibuprofen help with that pain\n[patient] it does it does help with the pain\n[doctor] okay and when you take your ibuprofen what can you what's your pain level then\n[patient] so this so what did i just say four\n[doctor] yes ma'am\n[patient] four out of ten so four out of ten is with ibuprofen\n[doctor] it's with ibuprofen okay what's your pain level without then\n[patient] i would say probably a six\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i'm sorry it's a six out of ten without ibuprofen and it goes down to like a one with ibuprofen\n[doctor] okay alright that that sounds good have you ever injured that foot and ankle before\n[patient] you know i've had a lot of injuries to my ankle but i've never hurt this ankle before i just realized an error\n[doctor] okay you know and i see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of a inner marrow soccer now\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] i'm i'm guessing you probably have n't been able to do that since you hurt your ankle\n[patient] no i have not been\n[doctor] so did you hear about the new major league soccer stadium and team that's coming to town they opened in the this year actually they built the stadium have you been down there yet\n[patient] no i have to get there\n[doctor] yeah we are all excited it's going to be a good time well have you experienced any numbness or tingling in that right foot\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam your vitals look good and everything there looks okay now i'm gon na do a focused exam on your right ankle i do appreciate some ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus malleolus associated with some edema or swelling of that area you are positive for tenderness to palpation of the anterior lateral soft tissue and now i do n't appreciate any laxity on anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation to that foot or ankle area now on neurovascular exam of your right foot you have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch and all of that is consistent with what's present on your left side as well so i did review the results of your of your x-ray the x-ray of your right ankle showed no fracture which is a good thing so now let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem of right ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain or i'm sorry right ankle sprain of your lateral ligament complex more specifically your anterior talofibular ligament now this ligament's on the outside of your ankle ankle which got stretched when you fell the best treatment at this time for your sprain is to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and let's continue to ice okay you're gon na be given an air cast which is gon na help stabilize that ankle and i'm also going to prescribe some crutches because i want you to stay off that leg and start walking on it stay off your leg for now and then in a couple of days start walking on it as tolerated do you have any questions or concerns for me\n[patient] so how long do you think it'll take to heal\n[doctor] so your symptoms should significantly improve over a few weeks but i'd like to follow up with you and see how you're doing let's say i'll see you again in fourteen days now i do want you to go ahead and continue to take nsaids or ibuprofen as needed to help with any pain and that's also gon na help reduce that inflammation and swelling okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright i will see you again in two weeks carolyn\n[patient] great thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome"}, {"id": "4097fe453c5e48e08cf172a8621a4caf", "document": "Patient

a smoker.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking allopurinol.\n\nVITALS\n\nOxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.\nBlood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.\nHeart Rate: 68 beats per minute.\nRespiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeck\n- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n\nCardiovascular\n- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\n\nHematology/Lymphatic/Immunology\n- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Nicotine dependence.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.\n\n2. Type 2 diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.\n- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.\n\n3. History of gout.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.\n- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nI would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] how are you doing\n[patient] i'm doing i'm

smoking is not good for me so i woke up and stopped and i actually did really well and i was able to quit smoking for almost a year and then things just started getting really stressful at work they started laying people off and i'm happy i still have a job but that also meant that i was responsible for more things so things just got stressful and i and just started picking it up again\n[doctor] well you are absolutely correct you know stress can often be a trigger for things like smoking and drinking have you thought what you would do this time when you encountered the stressful situations\n[patient] yeah i i did n't think about that a lot actually and one thing is i have started learning and trying to do more meditation and then i also just recently joined the gym so i'm really looking forward to working out again\n[doctor] okay well that's great to hear that you're getting back in the gym that will be good for your long term health too you know helping to maintain that type two diabetes you know those are really great strategies talking about gym for stress relief and and you know we have other products as well that you can use for an additional aid to help you stop smoking have you given any thought to using some type of smoking cessation aid at this time or or what do you think about that\n[patient] you know i've had you know because i've been trying to do cold turkey and it's not working and some of my friends actually have mentioned using a patch and they they've had some success with that so i think i would i would probably wan na start with

to see you because of this this knee pain that i've been having for about six months now\n[doctor] okay and do you remember what caused the pain initially\n[patient] honestly i do n't i ca n't think of anytime if i fell or like i i've really been trying to think and i ca n't really think of any specific event\n[doctor] okay now it it says here that it's in both knees is that correct\n[patient] yes both my knees\n[doctor] okay it kinda try let's let's try describing the pain for me please\n[patient] yeah it's kind of feels like it's like right behind my kneecaps\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and it's like a deep achy pain\n[doctor] a deep achy pain okay what kind of activities makes the pain feel worse\n[patient] let's see so anytime so if i'm sitting at my desk and i get up i have a lot of pain so anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs\n[doctor] okay so you work from home\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it\n[patient] no well first thing in the morning but otherwise it's downstairs\n[doctor] okay okay how do you like working from home\n[patient] you know it has it's plus and minuses\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i like it though my i like my commute\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i love it\n[doctor] and the parking i'm sure the parking is\n[patient] and the parking is great\n[doctor] yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better\n[patient] usually after like if i feel that pain and then i just it does get better\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all\n[patient] yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it takes the edge off\n[doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying\n[patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain\n[doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office\n[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile\n[doctor] yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up\n[patient] exactly\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it's\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before\n[patient] you know despite how active i am i you know i've never\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] injured or broken a bone\n[doctor] okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me\n[patient] so will i be able to run again\n[doctor] absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else\n[patient] no i think that's it\n[doctor] okay have a great day\n[patient] okay you too\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] bye"}, {"id": "c6398fd322aa485f985de64747ca2cd6", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N045-ACI082\nPatient Name: abigail nan\nAge: nan\nGender: female\nChief Complaint: Right knee

referred me to you\n[doctor] okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct\n[patient] yeah that's right\n[doctor] okay do

towards the afternoon\n[doctor] okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right\n[patient] that feels that feels normal\n[doctor] okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here\n[patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside\n[doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that\n[patient] no uh uh\n[doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan\n[patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym\n[doctor] yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in and they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do\n[patient] okay got it\n[doctor] any questions\n[patient] hmmm no i do n't think so\n[doctor] okay

nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nNew patient evaluation of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nThe patient was adopted and has no knowledge of any family history.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports unintentional weight loss\nGastrointestinal: Reports abdominal pain and constipation. Denies vomiting.\nGenitourinary: Reports abnormal vaginal bleeding. Denies urinary issues.\nPsychiatric: Reports depression\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\n- Examination of Abdomen: There is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. No rebounding or guarding.\n\nPelvic\n- Examination: There are no external lesions on the labia. The vaginal vault is within normal limits. The cervix is pink without lesions. On bimanual exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. No masses on the right.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of the abdomen was reviewed and demonstrated a 3 cm left ovarian mass with associated localized lymph node involvement. There is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Ovarian cancer.\n- Medical Reasoning: Looking at her abdominal CT results, it appears to be stage IIIA disease based on the lymph node involvement.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that the typical approach to treating this stage of cancer is surgical intervention followed by adjunct chemotherapy. The procedure and subsequent chemotherapy plans were discussed in detail. Given that she is young and otherwise healthy, I reassured her that I believe her prognosis is favorable based on her current status, however, this is dependent on the final pathology report. All of her questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: I want to start by ordering several blood tests including a CA-125, hCG, AFP, and LDH. I also want her to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if she has a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. I recommend we perform a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, as well as a lymph node dissection to remove any involved lymph nodes. Any concerning tissue will be biopsied and sent to pathology for staging. After she has recovered from surgery, she will start chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and Taxol. We may also consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] okay so we are recording okay so okay so i understand you've so you've got a past medical history of type two diabetes and

vaginal exam there are no external lesions on the labia the vaginal vault is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions and on bimanual exam i appreciate a left adnexal mass and there is no masses on the right okay so now i reviewed the results of your abdominal ct which show a three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease so lem me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem so i do think this is most likely ovarian cancer looking at your ct scan it looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement i want to start by sending off some blood tests like a ca-125 and hcg and afp and ldh these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor i'm dealing with and then i want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer so this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy so this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery okay so for the surgery i would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones i see and i'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all and we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports i then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol and based on how the surgery goes i may want you to receive intraperitoneal intraperitoneal chemo which is done inserting a small tube into your belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum now i know that was a lot sick in do you have any questions or\n[patient] am i gon na die\n[doctor] well that's a good question so based on what i see at this time i will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis and you're also still young and healthy which makes your prognosis even better and we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer though okay\n[patient] alright alright"}, {"id": "2ed080e38c8640ee996b44a8fc3b5fc6", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N047-ACI004\nPatient Name: Billy nan\nAge: nan\nGender: male\nChief Complaint: difficulty

emptying your bladder fully or do you feel like you still have some urine left in there when you when you finish\n[patient] most of the times i'm okay but sometimes if i stand there long enough i i can kinda go a little bit more so it's taking a while actually to just go to the bathroom\n[doctor] okay and are you waking up at night to go to the bathroom does it impact your sleep\n[patient] yeah i try to empty my bladder now right before i go to bed and and not drink anything but i'm still probably getting up three or four times a night to go to the bed\n[doctor] okay so you're getting up about three or four times a night and and how long has this been going on you said for about six months\n[patient] yeah six months to like this and it's probably been a little bit worse over the last

have like a catheter inserted\n[patient] my gosh no\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i'll do that\n[doctor] alright and have you ever seen a urologist i do n't think so you've been my patient for a while i do n't remember ever sending you but have you ever seen one\n[patient] i do n't think so\n[doctor] okay now tell me how are you doing with your with your heart when was the last time you saw doctor moore the cardiologist i know that you had the the stent placed in your right coronary artery about what was that twenty eighteen\n[patient] yeah sounds about right i think i just saw him in november

are okay alright now i wan na go ahead and just move on to a quick physical exam okay i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright i do have to do a rectal exam i apologize i'm just gon na be calling it out what what i what i appreciate okay so on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur hurt at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your abdominal exam your abdomen is nontender and nondistended i do n't appreciate any masses or any rebound or guarding on your prostate exam i do appreciate an enlarged prostate i do n't appreciate any masses on physical exam so what what does that mean billy so that ultimately means that you know everything looks good you know you have that little heart murmur which i believe you you've had in the past but we're gon na go ahead and look into that you know your prostate seems a little bit enlarged to me on physical exam so let's talk about how we can go about and and remedy that okay so for your first problem of this you know difficulty urinating i wan na go ahead and just order some routine labs i wan na get a a psa that kind of that ultimately kinda looks for prostate cancer issues which i do n't think you have because we did n't really appreciate that on physical exam i wan na go ahead and we can try to start you on what we call flomax zero point four milligrams once a day you should take it at night because it can cause people to get a little bit dizzy if they take it in the morning so i would take it at night and i wan na go ahead and refer you to a urologist just to look into this more so we can go ahead and and get this problem solved for you okay i'm also gon na go ahead and just order some routine blood tests just to make sure that we are not missing anything do you have any questions about that and i wan na go ahead and order a urinalysis and a urine culture\n[patient] yeah so sounds good have you seen that commercial for that super batter prostate stuff does that work\n[doctor] well i think the data it's it's i'm not really sure if it works or not i'm not that familiar with it let's just go ahead and stick with flomax and that's why we are gon na refer you to the urologist so that they can go ahead and talk to you about you know the most current treatment options for you okay\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] alright for your second problem of your coronary artery disease i wan na go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to follow up on that heart murmur that you had and i wan na go ahead and continue you on the lipitor forty milligrams a day and the aspirin and the metoprolol and i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel any questions about that\n[patient] nope\n[doctor] okay and then for your third problem of your diabetes it sounds like you're doing really well let's go ahead and continue you on the metformin a thousand milligrams twice a day we will go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to that and i'm gon na see you again in about three to four weeks okay i want you to call me or message me in the patient portal if you have any concerns\n[patient] alright when is the urologist gon na call me\n[doctor] i'm gon na reach out i'm gon na reach out to them now and see if they

nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBrittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.\n\nThe patient has a history of a left leg injury.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.\nNeurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nSKIN: Warm\nNEURO: Normal sensation.\nMSK:\nExamination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.\nExamination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] alright brittany so i see that you are experiencing some right foot pain could you tell me what happened\n[patient] yeah well i was playing tennis and i was trying to you know volley the ball\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] it was like a double game and i was trying to volley the ball and i got in front of another player and actually ended up falling on top of my foot\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] and then yeah it kinda hurt i quickly then twisted my myself around her because i was trying to catch myself but then i started to feel some pain in my foot\n[doctor] mm-hmm okay have you ever injured that foot before\n[patient] yeah no sorry i injured my other foot before not this foot\n[doctor] okay so right now you're experiencing right leg pain but you have injured your your left leg before is that what i'm hearing\n[patient] yeah that's fine\n[doctor] alright were you able to continue playing\n[patient] no i had to stop i actually it was like i had to be held from the field because i could n't put weight on my foot\n[doctor] i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then\n[patient] i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen\n[doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen\n[patient] this happened about couple days ago\n[doctor] okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all\n[patient] yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out\n[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling\n[patient] no no numbness\n[doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation\n[patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot\n[doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out\n[patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep\n[doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah\n[patient] that scares me\n[doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt\n[patient] no uh uh\n[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions\n[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery\n[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with\n[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc\n[doctor] i know\n[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too\n[doctor] so it's actually\n[patient] have to be in the hospital\n[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed\n[patient] i'm right handed\n[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what\n[patient] i mean\n[doctor] uh uh\n[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but\n[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there\n[patient] i suppose so\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] good\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] thank you"}, {"id": "66083c9530e04a0bb8c4aa31141742db", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N049-ACI048\nPatient Name: linda nan\nAge: nan\nGender: female\nChief Complaint: left sided

you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on\n[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] started having pain on my left back\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain\n[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go\n[patient] it's constant\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable\n[doctor] alright are you able to urinate\n[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood\n[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes\n[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time\n[doctor] third time alright\n[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever\n[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous\n[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain\n[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working\n[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved\n[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah\n[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so we are getting close there\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff\n[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff\n[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running\n[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the\n[doctor] the one eighties which was really high\n[patient] right\n[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that\n[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] like\n[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help\n[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright\n[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday\n[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds\n[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i do take it\n[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain\n[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain\n[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound\n[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you\n[doctor] okay no problem"}, {"id": "46d8a2e03bf8421f8f01220d77f2f4f1", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N050-ACI020\nPatient Name: Mason Ward\nAge: 80.0\nGender: male\nChief Complaint: kidney stones\nSecondary Complaints: nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nKidney stones.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nVitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight kidney stone.\n\nPLAN\n\nWe reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones your your pcp said you had some kidney stones so you got a referral over so can you tell me a little bit about that you know what happened when did you first notice them\n[patient] yeah it was about you know about a week ago and i was working down in the the barn with the horses and you know i was moving some hay but i developed this real sudden onset of pain in my right back and i thought it initially it was from throwing hay but it i broke out into a sweat i got real nauseated and that's when i went and saw my doctor and he ordered a cat scan and said that i had a kidney stone but you know that's i i've never had that before my father's had them in the past but yeah so that's that's how that all happened\n[doctor] okay so you said you had the pain on the right hand side does it move anywhere or radiate\n[patient] well when i had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] not the whole way down but almost to the groin and since then i have n't had any more pain and it's just been right about there\n[doctor] okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go\n[patient] well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and i've been straining my urine and you know i do n't see anything in there\n[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual\n[patient] no not really not really darker\n[doctor] okay so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them but\n[patient] i've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot but i've never had one\n[doctor] okay alright so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means\n[patient] i have a stroke\n[doctor] can you repeat that\n[patient] i did i have a stroke\n[doctor] no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good\n[patient] that sounds perfect dear too\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] thank you document\n[doctor] so i will see you in a week or so and hopefully you've passed that stone and i'll send my nurse in with that prescription\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] thanks"},

Diabetes;Coronary artery disease\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight foot ulcer.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.\n\nHe is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.\n\nIn terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fevers and chills.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain.\nRespiratory: Denies dyspnea.\nSkin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.\nNeurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.\n\nVITALS\n\nNo fever.\nBlood pressure: 127/80\nHeart rate: 60s\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.\nRESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nNECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits\nMSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot\n2. Diabetes\n3. Coronary artery disease\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.\n\nThe patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hi jeremy how are you\n[patient] i'm really good thank you how are you\n[doctor] i'm okay the the medical assistant told

backyard you know kind of you know doing some work and you know i know i you know i could've stepped on a nail or you know there was some other work but you know i'm always outside so i do n't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything\n[doctor] okay alright and have you had any fever or chills\n[patient] no no no fever or chills you know i kinda you know get headaches pretty often i do n't know if that you know i do n't know if that's a stress or but you know always have like the tension headaches in the front\n[doctor] okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get

know it's you know i just kinda feel like i've been just trying to take it easy lately\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but yeah most most of the stuff i've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house\n[doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin\n[patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day\n[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything\n[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams\n[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here\n[patient] no\n[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help\n[patient] any questions\n[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay\n[patient] sure\n[doctor] sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay\n[patient] okay perfect\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] perfect thank you so much\n[doctor] okay bye"}, {"id": "8b04701cd93d4524a86d95391da8dd53", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N052-ACI016\nPatient Name: Anna Diaz\nAge: 29.0\nGender: female\nChief Complaint: right-sided back pain\nSecondary Complaints: nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAnna Diaz is a pleasant 29-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right-sided back pain.\n\nFor approximately 1 week, the patient has been experiencing constant right-sided back pain that radiates down to her lower right side, as well as hematuria and nausea. Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Negative for fever.\nGastrointestinal: Positive for nausea. Negative for vomiting.\nGenitourinary: Positive for hematuria\n\nVITALS\n\nVitals are normal.\nBlood pressure is normal.\nHeart rate is normal.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nKidney stone, right side.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow up in 2 weeks.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] so anna good to see you today so reading here in your appointment notes you were you were diagnosed with kidney stones from your your pcp and you currently have one and so they they had you come in so can you tell me what happened how's all that going for you\n[patient] sure i've been having some back pain on my right side it's been lasting for about a week now\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i also started to see some blood in my urine\n[doctor] okay so on the right side so does that pain does it move anywhere or is it just kinda stay in that that one area\n[patient] yeah it's moved down a little bit on to my right lower side a little bit\n[doctor] side okay so how would you describe the pain is it constant or is does it come and go\n[patient] it's pretty constant\n[doctor] okay did you notice any pain when you're urinating i know i know you say you you saw you see blood but any pain with that\n[patient] no no real pain when i'm when i'm peeing at all\n[doctor] okay so have you taken anything i know have you tried like azo or any of that to\n[patient] i took some ibuprofen that helped a little bit\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but it still hurts even with ibuprofen\n[doctor] alright have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills\n[patient] i have n't thrown up but i felt a little bit nauseated\n[doctor] little nauseated yeah that's we expected so have you do you have a family history of kidney stones i know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but\n[patient] yeah my my dad had kidney stones i think he has passed a couple of them i'm not quite sure\n[doctor] alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one\n[patient] this is my first time i've never had this before\n[doctor] okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that\n[patient] yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone\n[doctor] okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain\n[patient] not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them\n[doctor] okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt\n[patient] a little bit yeah\n[doctor] a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far\n[patient] probably not enough i drink some but\n[doctor] okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me\n[patient] no i do n't think so\n[doctor] alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright"}, {"id": "2b0dba06479d401ba3da45eb6cd744a7", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N053-ACI074\nPatient Name: barbara nan\nAge: nan\nGender:

out of there something you know like a t gel or any of those other have those helped\n[patient] yeah i did that i did head and shoulders i even tried some castor oil and but none of them really seemed to be helping\n[doctor] okay okay let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss\n[patient] not that i can recall i've been pretty good otherwise\n[doctor] okay good and going back you know to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of\n[patient] no well maybe my sister\n[doctor] maybe your sister okay\n[patient] yeah maybe my sister i mean i know she'll is no one has as bad as i do but she does report like just having a dry scalp\n[doctor] okay okay now you know a lot of times we can see this with you know high levels of stress has there been any new mental or emotional stressors at work or at home\n[patient] not really i mean it's basically the same things\n[doctor] okay yeah i yeah we have a lot of that yes so let me go ahead and and look at this a little closer here the first off i wan na tell you the the vital signs that the my assistant took when you came in your blood pressure is one thirty over sixty eight your heart rate was ninety eight and your respiratory rate was eighteen so those all look good and appear normal and your temperature was ninety seven . seven and that is all normal now when i look at your scalp here i do notice that you have demarcated scaly erythematous plaques and that's just kind of explaining technically what's going on those patches and they're they're in a patchy format they're diffusely present across the back of your skull and that's probably why you you see all that that that white dander you know on your on your your clothes as you go through the day now lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan i think that you have a scalp psoriasis and let's and here is my thoughts on that what i would like you to use is to use clobetasol that's a zero . zero five percent solution and i want you to use that twice daily on the the affected areas of your scalp so you're just gon na put this on and just kinda gently rub it in now i know to do it twice daily is going to be difficult but if you can do it first thing in the morning when you get up and then before you go to bed you know get a shower and before you go to bed that will be great i want you to continue to use t-gel shampoo that you listed when you first came in that's a very good solution shampoo for that and that will help with controlling a lot of this now there is no cure for this unfortunately and flareups can be unpredictable but we see that you know not a we do n't have a great finger on what causes the flare ups but i'm gon na give you some steroids that will help and we're gon na have to manage that on a ongoing basis but when you get do get a flare up i want you to be using these flare steroid that i give you as we go through that and then i wan na see you back here in three months or sooner if it gets significantly worse do you have any questions for me\n[patient] no okay so i'll just use that steroid solution and then just as needed if it's really bad but then otherwise just use the t gel\n[doctor] yeah i want it's exactly what i want you to do i want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare but then other than that just continue to use that t-gel shampoo\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na have my nurse come in and get you discharged but i the we will see you again in three months or and again please if it gets worse please do n't hesitate to call me and come in sooner\n[patient] alright perfect thank you\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] okay bye"}, {"id": "0b0f11fb206d4804b55fc334020fbecf", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N054-ACI102\nPatient Name: elijah reyes\nAge: 45.0\nGender: male\nChief Complaint: right foot pain\nSecondary Complaints: Hx left ankle surgery\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight foot pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nElijah Reyes is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The patient was referred by his primary care physician. He sustained an injury yesterday when he dropped a landscape brick on his right foot while doing yard work. He was able to get up and continue working after the injury. He rates his pain level as an 11 out of 10. The patient also reports numbness in his entire right foot, which has been present for a long time. The patient denies taking any medication for pain.\n\nThe patient reports he fractured his right ankle 20 years ago. He received non-operative treatment with casting. He has experienced intermittent soreness and swelling in his right ankle since then.\n\nThe patient reports surgical history of his left ankle. He continues to experience soreness and occasional giving way of the left ankle.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of a right ankle fracture 20 years ago.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of left ankle surgery.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain, right ankle soreness and swelling, and left ankle soreness and instability.\nNeurological: Reports right foot numbness.\n\nVITALS\n\nAll vital signs are within the normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Capillary refill is brisk in less than 3 seconds in the right foot. Strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse.\nNEURO: Normal sensation. Right foot motor and sensation are intact and equal to the contralateral side.\nMSK: Examination of the right foot: Bruising on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. I do appreciate associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation over the midfoot.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAn x-ray of the right foot was obtained and reviewed today. It demonstrates dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight foot pain, due to a Lisfranc fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I advised him that this procedure will be performed in an outpatient setting and he will be discharged home that same evening. He will then follow up with me 24 hours post procedure, and again 2 weeks later. I explained that he will be placed in a cast and will remain non-weight-bearing for 6 to 8 weeks. He will use crutches while ambulating and we will advance his weight-bearing gradually based on how he tolerates the procedure.\n\nI have also recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right foot to further assess the ligaments. I explained to him that if he has poor bone alignment or ligament healing, this can lead to losing the arch in his foot causing pes planus and developing arthritis. I will send an order to the outpatient MRI facility downstairs for him to obtain the MRI this afternoon.\n\nThe patient wishes to think over his options before proceeding with the operation.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey elijah how are you\n[patient] i'm doing okay\n[doctor] so i see here that your primary care provider sent you over it looks like you were doing some yard work yesterday and dropped a landscape brick on your foot can what so what's going on with your right foot today\n[patient] it's a little sore today but you know i hurt my foot before but this is the first time where i'm actually being seen for it\n[doctor] okay so you say you've injured your right foot before tell me a little bit about that injury\n[patient] twenty years ago i broke my ankle i had to put in a cast but that seems to be okay but you know sometimes it'll give me trouble once in a while it feels a little sore it swells up at times\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and my other ankle too is sore sometimes and i've had surgery for that too and you know one of those things where you know it might give out once in a while but i'm not sure that's related to what the you know break dropping on my foot but you know either way my foot's a little sore\n[doctor] okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident\n[patient] i you know it was a little sore i called a few names you know god damn why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it\n[doctor] so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult\n[patient] lucken it up\n[doctor] okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain\n[patient] no i feel like taking the medicine\n[doctor] okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet\n[patient] no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a trip once my foot heals\n[doctor] alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life\n[patient] eleven out of ten\n[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident\n[patient] yeah the whole foot is numb\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but been now for a long time\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that\n[patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast\n[doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible\n[patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri\n[doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon\n[patient] can i think about it and we have some time\n[doctor] sure\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright thanks elijah"}, {"id": "951e9afef25c4b448da8ba0602e85fba", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N055-ACI053\nPatient Name: karen nelson\nAge: 3.0\nGender: female\nChief Complaint: right eye twitch\nSecondary Complaints: nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight eye twitch.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient plays soccer every Saturday, however she has noted that there is a girl that tries to kick her and pulls her hair.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPatient's father reports that they do not have a family history of seizures or Tourette's syndrome.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever, chills, or changes in appetite.\nEyes: Reports right eye twitch. Denies right eye pain.\nRespiratory: Denies cough.\nNeurological: Denies headaches or sleep disturbances.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\n- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. Gait is steady. Heel toe walking is normal. Cranial nerves grossly intact without focal neurologic findings. No pronator drift. Sensation is intact. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Transient tics.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient's father provided a video today as she did not have a twitch in office. It appears the patient is experiencing a tic.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: Nature of the diagnosis was discussed today with the patient and her father. I advised eye tics are very common in children and as many as 1 in 5 children have a tick during their school years. We discussed tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, sniffling, excessive throat clearing, and uncontrolled vocalization. I explained that essentially they are brief, sudden and involuntary motor movements and that we do not have a full understanding of the cause. We also discussed that they typically occur around 5 to 10 years of age and mostly resolve on their own within a year. Dad was advised that treatment is not recommended as they do not appear to be bothering Karen and she continues to do well in school and activities. Additionally, we discussed avoiding drawing attention to the tic as it may cause Karen to feel self-conscious and increase the severity of the tic.\n- Medical Treatment: None at this time.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient's parent understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. \nAll questions were answered.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] karen nelson is a 3 -year-old female with no significant past medical history who comes in for evaluation of a new right eye twitch karen is accompanied by her father hi karen how are you\n[patient] i'm okay i guess\n[doctor] hey dad how are you doing\n[patient] hey doc i am okay yeah karen has been having this

feel my face sometimes\n[doctor] yeah and do you have any pain when it happens\n[patient] no it it does n't really hurt but i noticed that dad looks real nervous when it happens\n[doctor] yeah i i i can understand that's because he loves you do you feel the urge to move your face\n[patient] sometimes and then it moves and then i feel better\n[doctor] okay okay and so so dad how often are you seeing the twitch on karen\n[patient] i do n't know i mean it varies sometimes i see it several times an hour and there is other days we do n't see it at all until sometimes late afternoon but we definitely notice it you know everyday for the last several weeks\n[doctor] okay so karen how is how is how is soccer\n[patient] i like soccer\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] yeah dad dad takes me to play every saturday\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's it's pretty fun but there's this girl named isabella she she plays rough\n[doctor] does she\n[patient] she yeah she tries to kick me and she pulls my hair

and and then sometimes after soccer we we go and i get mcdugge's and it and it's it makes for a nice day with dad\n[doctor] is that your favorite at mcdonald's in the the mcnuggates\n[patient] not not really but they are cheap so\n[doctor] okay alright well you you made dad happy at least right\n[patient] yeah that's what he says because i'm expensive because i want dresses and dogs and stuff all the time\n[doctor] yeah well yeah who does n't well okay well hopefully we will get you you know squared away here so you can you know play your soccer and go shopping for dresses with dad so so dad tell me does the karen seem bothered or any other and have any other issues when this happens\n[patient] no i mean when it happens she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens\n[doctor] okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally\n[patient] i i'd say she seems fine i mean she has been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really\n[doctor] okay good\n[patient] never even though anything was going on\n[doctor] okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching\n[patient] well no uh it's just her face\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i mean the whole side of her face moves when it happens it seems like it several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently and and and you know wait a minute i i did make a video so you can see just in case it does n't do it during the visit\n[doctor] okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome\n[patient] well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing\n[doctor] yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger\n[patient] really i had nobody in our family got anything like that\n[doctor] okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay coughing headache\n[patient] ma'am\n[doctor] okay how about any problems with karen's sleep\n[patient] nope\n[doctor] okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] does that feel the same\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen\n[patient] that's great\n[doctor] good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me\n[patient] so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing\n[doctor] yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards\n[patient] so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing\n[doctor] not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay\n[patient] alright alright sounds good\n[doctor] alright thank you you guys have a good day\n[patient] doctor\n[doctor] bye karen"}, {"id": "0341ef9ec1f14d77b1d5940b99443029", "document":

Recurrent lung infections.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms seem consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He is a farmer and has been moving hay quite frequently recently.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.\n- Medical Treatment: A course of oral steroids were prescribed today to help decrease his lung inflammation. CT of the lungs will also be ordered today to confirm the diagnosis. A pulmonary function test was also ordered to assess the severity of his respiratory impairment.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[patient] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on\n[doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever\n[patient] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms\n[doctor] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot\n[patient] okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or\n[doctor] urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room\n[patient] wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for\n[doctor] you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week\n[patient] mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm\n[doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay\n[patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay\n[doctor] no i do n't do that\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] none of us do\n[patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either\n[doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick\n[patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him\n[doctor] you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load\n[patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings\n[doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us\n[patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings\n[doctor] yeah i'm okay\n[patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place\n[doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family\n[patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies\n[doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies\n[patient] okay and do you smoke\n[doctor] i do n't smoke\n[patient] do you live with anybody who does\n[doctor] i do not\n[patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions\n[doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick\n[patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help\n[doctor] okay it does\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] okay no problem\n[doctor] alright"}, {"id": "1488167ac0834b9085a49f7904f4a6c0", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N057-ACI100\nPatient Name: joseph walker\nAge: 58.0\nGender: male\nChief Complaint: Right great toe pain\nSecondary Complaints: nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight great toe pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJoseph Walker is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right great toe pain. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, however it worsened last week. He noticed the pain worsening when he was at a trade show convention and he could not ambulate as he was forced to stand there as the pain was there the whole time. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain usually as throbbing and burning, but notes it occasionally changes to sharp, stabbing pain especially with movement or prolonged ambulation. His symptoms also include redness to the right great toe. The patient states that he has been ambulating on his heel to keep his toe from bending. He reports that his pain is present even with the slightest of pressure, which he notes is worse at night when his sheet is touching his right toe. He adds that he has been taking 2 ibuprofen per day, which does not provide him with relief.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports that he likes to bicycle ride.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right great toe pain.\nSkin: Reports redness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the right great toe reveals 10 degrees of plantar flexion with pain. Pain to palpation of the right great toe, between the big toe and 2nd toe. Palpated a bone spur on the right great toe.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the right great toe taken today in office reveals a large bone spur on the anterior aspect of the right great toe joint. There is a loss of cartilage with some arthritis present.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight foot hallux rigidus.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed hallux rigidus. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of custom orthotics. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam once a day to treat the pain. The patient was instructed to discontinue use and contact the office if gastrointestinal issues develop. I advised the patient that I want him to continue his regular activities.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the orthotics, I will recommend a cortisone injection or surgical intervention.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[patient] hi good afternoon joseph how are you doing today\n[doctor] i'm doing well but my my big toe hurts and it's a little red too but it really hurts okay how long has this been going on i would say you know off and on for about two weeks but last week is is when it really became painful i was at a a trade show convention and i could n't walk the halls i could n't do anything i just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time i was there\n[patient] okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it\n[doctor] it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending\n[patient] okay sorry i got a text and\n[doctor] well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all\n[patient] no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner\n[doctor] my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails\n[patient] yeah those those are nice\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] does it does riding your bike bother your big toe\n[doctor] no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side\n[patient] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal\n[doctor] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops\n[patient] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started\n[doctor] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned\n[patient] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother\n[doctor] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot\n[patient] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine\n[doctor] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alrighty\n[patient] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom\n[doctor] yeah ouch\n[patient] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt\n[doctor] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down\n[patient] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt\n[doctor] yeah it a little when you take it a little further\n[patient] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt\n[doctor] that hurts more yeah\n[patient] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt\n[doctor] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too\n[patient] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt\n[doctor] a little bit but not terrible\n[patient] okay what about if i push on the other side here\n[doctor] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yep\n[patient] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back\n[doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in\n[patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint\n[doctor] oh\n[patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage\n[doctor] oh\n[patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach\n[doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach\n[patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes\n[doctor] is that surgery\n[patient] i have to\n[doctor] would that be\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint\n[patient] yeah that would\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer\n[doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done\n[patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks\n[doctor] okay where i really like catching blue going croppy so okay we'll we'll i'll i'll keep working then i'll find time to do that later\n[patient] very good we will see you in two weeks\n[doctor] okay thank you"}, {"id": "49cb2a7d55064cf08d12c365d58f71f7", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N058-ACI054\nPatient Name: russell

legs if i'm not careful\n[doctor] right\n[patient] and it's gon na be hard because you know i i really do like pizza and and they told me that i'm really gon na have to watch salt and they said that there is a lot of salt and pizza\n[doctor] there is a lot of salt and pizza and you know and you're gon na have to be able to avoid all the other salty foods as well so and i know that's hard but it's very important for your heart to be able to function at it's best right and you wan na be able to get out and walk you know walk take those walks again at the park and then you know do your

monitor that okay let me listen to your lungs here real quick russell your lungs are clear so good good and your extremities i do n't see any swelling or edema on your right radial artery the cath site there is clean and it's dry and intact and i do n't see any hematoma so that's good and there is a palpable rra pulse so russell i did review the results of your ekg which showed normal sinus

will recover so that said i want you to go ahead and continue continue your lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i do n't think you need a diuretic at this time but i do want to add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and then you'll need to get labs next week okay and then we're gon na repeat another echocardiogram echocardiocardiogram in about two months\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay and then for your hypertension your third diagnosis of hypertension i want your to take your blood pressure just like you would you know every so often and then because your blood pressures actually seem

little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it\n[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today\n[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo\n[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it\n[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were\n[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now\n[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler\n[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night\n[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports\n[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens\n[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too\n[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem\n[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening\n[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] for the symptoms\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so\n[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack\n[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening\n[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout\n[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems\n[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense\n[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having\n[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do\n[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation\n[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too\n[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and everything sounds good\n[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes\n[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that\n[doctor] yeah i think so yeah\n[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal\n[doctor] awesome\n[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it\n[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that\n[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you\n[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year\n[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too\n[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay\n[patient] thank you"}, {"id": "8d1b828c2a2148309f1d15709b36b3eb", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N060-ACI080\nPatient Name: jean martinez\nAge: 27.0\nGender: female\nChief Complaint: Left foot pain\nSecondary Complaints: nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft foot pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.\n\nThe patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.\n\nOf note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.\nNeurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure: 118/72 mmHg\nHeart rate: 58 bpm\nRespiratory rate: 14\nTemperature: Afebrile\nOxygen saturation: 99% on room air\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.\nRESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.\nNEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.\nMSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLisfranc fracture, left foot.\n\nPLAN\n\nI explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nWe will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today\n[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have\n[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened\n[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot\n[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before\n[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot\n[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing\n[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field\n[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then\n[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well\n[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three\n[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] like a seven eight\n[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer\n[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time\n[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else\n[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school\n[doctor] that's\n[patient] high school teams\n[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome"}, {"id": "196c54ee0bd444d3a711a6b963994250", "document": "Patient ID: aci-D2N061-ACI038\nPatient Name: Virginia nan\nAge: 53.0\nGender: female\nChief Complaint: Right knee pain\nSecondary Complaints: diabetes\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight knee pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nVirginia Phillips is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of her pain began 7 days ago, when she was playing basketball and another player ran into her. She states that she fell to the ground and landed on her side. She denies hearing or feeling a pop at the time of the injury. The patient localizes her pain to the medial aspect of her knee. She used ice and an ACE wrap right after the injury. Today, she notes that she has been doing exercises, ice, and Mobic for pain control.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports she is a diabetic who takes her blood sugar every morning.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports that she plays basketball at the Y for fun.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports that she takes metformin 500 mg twice a day.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: No pain to palpation of the lateral aspect of the right knee. Pain with palpation on the medial aspect of the knee. Ecchymosis and swelling on the medial aspect of the knee. Effusion is appreciated. Decreased ROM. Negative varus and valgus stress test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the right knee taken in office today reveal the bony alignment in good position. There is no evidence of any fractures. There is effusion present.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible medial collateral ligament strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.\n\nRegarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on her progress. If her swelling has not improved, we will consider obtaining a CT or MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible medial collateral ligament strain.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hi virginia how're you today\n[patient] i'm good thanks how are you\n[doctor] good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened\n[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts\n[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't\n[patient] i did fall to the ground\n[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on\n[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on\n[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question\n[patient] not really\n[doctor] no\n[patient] he does n't have much game\n[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts\n[patient] on the inside\n[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything\n[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap\n[doctor] you had ice and what\n[patient] an ace wrap\n[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly\n[patient] seven\n[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct\n[patient] correct\n[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home\n[patient] every morning\n[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this\n[patient] i did not no\n[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today\n[patient] some exercises ice and mobic\n[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal\n[patient] yes it hurts\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me\n[patient] when can i play basketball again\n[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball\n[patient] i just played the wife with fun\n[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot

nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft ankle pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMatthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking ibuprofen.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nVitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.\nMSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThese reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey matthew how're you doing\n[patient] hey doc i'm doing pretty good how are you\n[doctor] i'm doing pretty good hey i see here in the nurse's notes it looks like you hurt your left ankle can you tell me a little bit more about that\n[patient] yeah i did my wife and i were on a walk yesterday and i was just talking to her and and stepped off the curb and landed on it wrong it's kind of embarrassing but yeah it's been killing me for a couple days now\n[doctor] okay now when you fell did you feel or hear a pop or anything like that\n[patient] i would n't say i really heard a pop it was just kind of really kind of felt extended and stretched and it it's just been really bothering me ever since kind of on the outside of it\n[doctor] okay and then were you able to walk on it after the incident\n[patient] i was able to get back to the house because i did n't wan na you know make my wife carry me but it was it was painful\n[doctor] okay and then have you done any or had any injuries to that ankle before\n[patient] nothing substantial that i would say in the past\n[doctor] okay and then what have you been doing for that left ankle since then have you done anything to help make it make the pain less\n[patient] i have taken some ibuprofen and then i just tried to elevate it and ice it a little bit and keep my weight off of it\n[doctor] okay so let's talk real quick about your pain level zero being none ten being the worst pain you've been in in your life without any medication on board can you rate your pain for me\n[patient] i would say it's about an eight\n[doctor] okay and then when you do take that ibuprofen or tylenol what what's your relief level what's your pain look like then\n[patient] maybe a seven it it's a little\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned going for a walk my wife and i've been on on back behind the new rex center where the new trails are have you guys been back there\n[patient] we have n't yet but i'm sure we'll check it out ever since i feel like working at home during covid we we we take walks all the time\n[doctor] yeah i\n[patient] no i have n't been there yet\n[doctor] yeah those those trails are great there's like five miles of regular flat trails and then there's a bunch of hiking trails that they've opened up as well it's a really great place man you guys need to get out there we'll get you fixed up and we'll get you back out there okay\n[patient] awesome\n[doctor] so let's let's talk a little bit about my physical exam if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you your vitals look stable by the way a little elevated i know you're in pain on a focused exam of your left ankle now i do appreciate that there is ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus and there is some swelling i do i do appreciate some edema now you are positive for tenderness to palpation on the lateral side and the the soft tissue is swollen here the good news is i do not appreciate any laxity in the joint okay and i do n't feel any any type of bony tenderness to palpation of your foot now on the neurovascular exam of your left foot capillary refill is brisk less than three seconds and i do appreciate strong dorsalis pedis pulses and you do have motor and sensation intact which is good now it's important that they were compared bilaterally and they are yeah your your exam is the same bilaterally so that that's an important thing now we did do an x-ray of that left ankle when you came in so i'm gon na review those x-ray results with you now the good news is i do not appreciate a fracture or any bony abnormalities so that's a good thing right so let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of your left ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex and the ligament on the outside of your ankle is what got stretched when you fell now the best treatment for this sprain is what you've kind of already been doing doing the elevation and compression and ice so we're gon na continue the rice protocol and i am gon na go ahead and give you an air cast just to stabilize that ankle i'm gon na prescribe you some crutches i want you to stay off that leg but i do want you to start walking as tolerated but it may be a few days before you feel like doing that now your symptoms are going to get better significantly over the first you know four five six seven days but i am gon na wan na follow up with you just to make sure you're doing okay so what i do is i would like to see you in two weeks and i'm gon na have you continue taking those nsaids as well to help reduce that pain and swelling any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in and get you fixed up\n[patient] no i think that sounds like a plan\n[doctor] okay sounds good like i said i will see you in two weeks if you have any questions or if you have a lot of pain come back in we'll reevaluate otherwise i think you're headed in the right direction and i'll see you again in two weeks\n[patient] awesome thanks

some\n[doctor] okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise\n[patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but\n[doctor] sure\n[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay\n[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that\n[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff\n[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all\n[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though\n[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while\n[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related\n[doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today\n[patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think\n[doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so\n[patient] these are like my video visit exams\n[doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it

The patient states that her pain has been slowly increasing over the last few days. She experiences limping with ambulation. The patient states that her pain lasts for as long as she is ambulating. She denies radiating pain. She also reports constant swelling and stiffness in the morning. Her stiffness will resolve with ambulation. The patient has been wearing a brace and using THC cream, which has been helpful. She denies taking any medications for pain, however she has been utilizing THC gummies, which have been beneficial.\n\nThe patient has a history of a right knee reconstruction when she was 14 years old. She states that she was a good gymnast at that time. The patient adds that she has had problems with her right knee since that time. She denies any other exercises outside of intense gym and ski events. The patient states that she normally skis 3 times per week.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports a history of total right knee reconstruction at the age of 14.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nShe denies needing medications.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, swelling, and stiffness. Denies left knee pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild effusion. The patient ambulated with an antalgic gait. Pain with dorsiflexion, but not with plantarflexion.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.\n\nRegarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hi elizabeth so i see that you were experiencing some kind of

n't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing i was fourteen i was a really good gymnast back then really good\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i was doing a back summer salt and i felt a pop then and then since that time i've really had problems with my knee\n[doctor] uh uh\n[patient] but you know the athlete that i am i can still really ski very well so i just kept going\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i'm really tough my pain tolerance is very high\n[doctor] okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events\n[patient] no i think that's about it\n[doctor] okay and how frequently do you normally ski\n[patient] i ski probably three times a week\n[doctor] okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright what\n[patient] nothing no\n[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright so when i move your your kneecap does that hurt\n[patient] no it kinda makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but it does n't hurt my knee\n[doctor] okay so does the pain radiate frequently\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i've never really noticed it just messed with my kneecap\n[doctor] okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar\n[patient] yeah i waddle pretty pretty good now\n[doctor] okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright do you have any questions right now\n[patient] no thank you so much\n[doctor] no problem"}], "test": [{"id": "f549fd551c0240deb921594bdde99d2d", "document": "Patient ID: virtassist-D2N068-VA052\nPatient Name: Brian  White\nAge: 58\nGender: male\nChief Complaint:

i'm pressing ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .\n[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?\n[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .\n[patient] lovely .\n[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?\n[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .\n[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .\n[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .\n[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .\n[patient] okay , that sounds great .\n[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .\n[patient] thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks ."}, {"id": "10cc26d3967a4af0bd423663ea252d52", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N074-VS024\nPatient Name: bruce ward\nAge: 52\nGender: male \nChief Complaint: Pituitary lesion\nSecondary Complaints: headaches\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nPituitary lesion.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with a pituitary lesion. The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.\n\nThe patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.\n\nMr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.\n\nThe patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nNewly diagnosed pituitary lesion.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo known family history; adopted.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployment Status: Works as a computer programmer.\nMarital Status: Married for 25 years.\nLiving Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house.\nAlcohol Use: None.\nTobacco Use: Non-smoker.\nRecreational Drugs: None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\nPatient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.\n\nEyes\nVisual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.\n\nRESULTS\n\nLabs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.\n\nIndependent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Pituitary adenoma\n\u2022 Bitemporal hemianopia\n\nMr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.\n\nPLAN\n\nPituitary adenoma.\nWe discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.\n\nBitemporal hemianopia.\nWe will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n\u2022 Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.\n\u2022 Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] patient , bruce ward . date of birth 5/21/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with dia- newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical intervention . mr . ward presented to his primary care provider , dr. howard , on 3/1/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past clinical history is unremarkable .\n[doctor] worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted .\n[doctor] hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .\n[patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .\n[doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?\n[patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .\n[doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?\n[patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .\n[doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ?\n[patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .\n[doctor] okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ?

The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.\n\nThe patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.\n\nThe patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nUterine fibroids.\nAnemia.\n\nSurgical\nCholecystectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNone reported.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022\u202fCardiovascular:\u202f Positive for chest pain.\n\u2022\u202fGastrointestinal:\u202f Positive for difficulty swallowing.\n\u2022\u202fPsychiatric:\u202f Positive for stress.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nMild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe patient\u2019s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient\u2019s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.\n\nNon-cardiac chest pain.\n\nSuspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.\n\nPLAN\n\n\u2022 We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n\u2022 Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs.\n\u2022 Follow up as needed.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ?\n[patient] good morning . yes . that's me .\n[doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you .\n[patient] nice to meet you too .\n[doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ?\n[patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .\n[doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?\n[patient] um , early october .\n[doctor] of 2020 , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?\n[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .\n[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?\n[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .\n[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?\n[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .\n[doctor] okay . i see .\n[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .\n[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?\n[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .\n[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?\n[patient] yes . with eating .\n[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?\n[patient] mm-hmm . i did .\n[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?\n[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .\n[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .\n[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .\n[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?\n[patient] they're normal .\n[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?\n[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .\n[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?\n[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .\n[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?\n[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .\n[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?\n[patient] i'd say it's about the same .\n[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .\n[patient] okay . good .\n[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .\n[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .\n[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?\n[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .\n[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .\n[patient] no . that's it . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks ."}, {"id": "b91ffc72e5e74cffbeb25840a683aa04", "document": "Patient ID: virtscribe-D2N076-VS021\nPatient Name: katherine lopez\nAge: 22-month\nGender: female \nChief Complaint: renal screening tests\nSecondary Complaints: none\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRenal screening tests.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nKatherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow\u2019s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where \u201cthe kidneys fuse into one\u201d and issues with their legs.\n\nThe patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates \u201ca lot\u201d. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow\u2019s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism.\n\nBIRTH HISTORY\n\nTwin gestation.

aci-D2N077-ACI110\nPatient Name: diana scott\nAge: 61.0\nGender: female\nChief Complaint: Right wrist injury\nSecondary Complaints: nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight wrist injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.\n\nThe patient is going on vacation in 1 month.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right wrist pain and swelling.\nNeurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg.\nHeart Rate: 80 beats per minute.\nRespiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute.\nBody Temperature: 97.2 degrees F.\nHEAD: Normocephalic\nNECK: No swelling noted\nCV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nGI/GU: Non-distended\nBACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity\nNECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly.\nMSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight wrist Colles fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.\n\nIn the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened\n[patient] yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen\n[doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right\n[patient] it's my right one of course\n[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain\n[patient] gosh it's like a nine\n[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it\n[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] really\n[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen\n[patient] this happened yesterday morning\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just not it's really bad\n[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry\n[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally\n[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just really along my wrist\n[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling\n[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling\n[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well\n[patient] yeah it does\n[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like\n[patient] not without extreme pain\n[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up\n[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually\n[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright and then lateral as well\n[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason\n[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist\n[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight\n[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you\n[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all\n[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down\n[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better\n[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] pardon what\n[patient] a what\n[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay\n[patient] when do i have to have the surgery\n[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so what\n[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace\n[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks\n[patient] six weeks\n[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of\n[patient] oof\n[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions\n[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so\n[doctor] okay how long is the vacation\n[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks\n[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks\n[patient] no vacation in a month\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] no problem bye\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is

a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly\n[patient] yes i have\n[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that\n[patient] i definitely need some help there

fluid in there as well so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you did n't break anything so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have what we call a mcl strain so a medial collateral ligament strain so when you fell i think you twisted a little bit and so it irritated you strained

nan\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft shoulder pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nWayne Taylor is a pleasant 66-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago. He denies any specific injury. The patient states he is active and has been renovating his basement. He reports a history of intermittent aches and pains in his left shoulder. He has difficulty reaching for or lifting any objects. He adds that he avoids reaching overhead secondary to the pain. The patient describes his pain as constant and worsening. He notes his pain is unbearable when lying on his left shoulder at night. He denies any numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities. He has been taking 2 Extra Strength Tylenol every 6 to 8 hours, which provides some relief.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities.\n\nVITALS\n\nAll vital signs are within the normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCapillary refill is less than 3 seconds.\n\nNEURO: Normal sensation. Sensation is intact to light touch in the left upper extremity.\nMSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and are reviewed today. These reveal there are no fractures.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft shoulder pain, most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. I recommend obtaining an MRI of the left shoulder to further assess the rotator cuff. I will also refer him to formal physical therapy to strengthen his left shoulder for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. The patient was provided with educational materials regarding expectations related to his physical therapy. He may continue to take Tylenol as needed. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, we will consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder. All questions were answered.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me after he has completed his course of physical therapy.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hi wayne how're you today\n[patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having\n[doctor] okay and how long have you had this pain\n[patient] about i want to say a few weeks i think it's been about three weeks now\n[doctor] okay and do you remember what you were doing when the pain started\n[patient] honestly i've been trying to recall if i had any specific injury and i ca n't think of that\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] of anything the only thing i can think of is that i you know i am active and we've just been doing a lot of work in our basement so if i do n't know if i did something while doing that\n[doctor] okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before\n[patient] you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of\n[doctor] okay good but now are you able to move your arm\n[patient] you know i have trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt\n[doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go\n[patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable\n[doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain\n[patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours\n[doctor] alright and and did that help\n[patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain\n[doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you\n[patient] yeah i mean it's been fun but yeah i think it really did take a toll on me\n[doctor] yeah what what are you doing with your basement are you are you doing like a a man cave or\n[patient] yeah yeah that's exactly right\n[doctor] that is awesome great well that sounds like fun i hope you get to set it up just the way you you would like for your man cave to be so congratulations to you there so tell me have you experienced any kind of numbness in your arms or in your hands\n[patient] no no numbness or tingling\n[doctor] okay alright so let's just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i did review your vitals everything here looks good now lem me take a look at your shoulder alright now on your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion and how does that feel here\n[patient] that hurts\n[doctor] okay sorry there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips alright and then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so what does that all mean well firstly lem me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here now i reviewed the results and there are no fractures so that's good so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here wayne so for your problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles so i will be ordering an mri for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] now i'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and during that

diabetes\n\n---------------------------------------------\nMEDICAL NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft knee pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAndrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.\n\nThe patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.\n\nIn terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 98.2 degrees F\nHeart rate: 72 bpm\nRespirations: 16\nBlood pressure: 122/70 mmHg\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.\nExamination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Left knee pain.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.\n\nHer hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.\n\nShe has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] okay hi andrea well i\n[patient] hello\n[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you

so with your x-rays i reviewed the result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a

time alright hello beverly how are you\n[patient] i'm good today\n[doctor] you're good today yeah you've been going through a lot lately i know you just had your treatment how how are your symptoms\n[patient] my symptoms are pretty good today i just kind of have a minimal cough and a sore throat\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but that's all i'm feeling today\n[doctor] okay and how about fatigue have you been feeling more tired\n[patient] yes a little bit\n[doctor] okay and how about any nausea or vomiting\n[patient] no not as of today\n[doctor] okay and i know you were mentioning a cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath\n[patient] i have n't noticed any shortness of breath it just kind of seems to be a lingering kind of light dry cough\n[doctor] cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough\n[patient] more dry\n[doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat\n[patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] to see if it can it you know the dry coughing if it's part of that or what i can do\n[doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there\n[patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would\n[doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems\n[patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong\n[doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone\n[patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me\n[doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue\n[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming\n[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far\n[patient] that sounds great thank you\n[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss\n[patient] great\n[doctor] okay any questions for me\n[patient] i do n't believe so at this time\n[doctor] okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit\n[patient] great thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome and so now just"}, {"id":

immunoglobulin A level. He was referred to our offices by his primary care physician after routine labs revealed abnormalities. The patient states he has been experiencing frequent infections. During the winter months, he experiences frequent colds that tend to linger, however this is not uncommon for him. The patient denies abdominal issues or diarrhea.\n\nThe patient was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

I have explained to him that the results of his recent lab work is consistent with an IgA deficiency. I have recommended that we obtain additional blood work to check his other antibodies. I encouraged the patient to be aware of lingering infections or abdominal changes including diarrhea. If he experiences these issues, he should report them to my office so we may investigate further, however I do not believe there is a need for that at this time. In the meantime, he should report this IgA deficiency in the event that he needs any blood transfusions. Questions were invited and answered today.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] you're ready just\n[doctor] ready\n[patient] hi kyle how are you today\n[doctor] i'm doing well i'm just anxious about my pcp told me that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today\n[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding\n[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me\n[patient] yeah that's a mouthful\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here\n[doctor] i'll do this\n[patient] i i think i would break that\n[doctor] yeah i just saw that\n[patient] if you can do that\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up\n[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me\n[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections\n[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual\n[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections\n[doctor] diarrhea no\n[patient] frequently\n[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of\n[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies\n[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy\n[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes\n[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street\n[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes\n[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that\n[doctor] i know i know\n[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away\n[doctor] right\n[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products\n[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally\n[patient] okay where did you go\n[doctor] i was in zambia\n[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful\n[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time\n[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial\n[doctor] no\n[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you\n[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried\n[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea\n[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and\n[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency\n[doctor] why is that\n[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency\n[doctor] okay okay thank you\n[patient] you're welcome\n[doctor] okay"}, {"id": "55f65017e25543f883f7994642ff6a9a", "document": "Patient ID:

NOTE:\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight elbow pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.\n\nOver the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the \"inside\" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nNormal\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight medial epicondylitis.\n\nPLAN\n\nThe patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 1 week.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing\n[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this elbow pain\n[doctor] so it looks like here that you came in to see us today for an evaluation of that right elbow pain can you tell me can you can you tell me well first of all what do you think has been causing that pain\n[patient] so i really during this pandemic i really got into ceramics and doing pottery so i've been doing a lot of pottery and over the past week i then started to develop this elbow pain\n[doctor] okay and then so tell me a little bit more about that elbow pain where does it hurt exactly\n[patient] you know it hurts a lot in the inside of my elbow\n[doctor] okay so the inside of your right elbow okay\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that\n[patient] it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm\n[doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything\n[patient] no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything\n[doctor] okay and you've never injured that right elbow before\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life\n[patient] i would say probably a six\n[doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities\n[patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain\n[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on\n[patient] about four days now\n[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief\n[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much\n[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here\n[patient] yes i do\n[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that\n[patient] not really\n[doctor] okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that\n[patient] yeah that hurts\n[doctor] okay so you do have pain you were positive for pain when you pronate that that that forearm okay i'm gon na go ahead and have you rest your arm on the table here palm side up now i want you to raise your hand by bending at the wrist and i'm gon na put some resistance against it do you have any pain when i press against your flexed wrist\n[patient] yes i do\n[doctor] alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend\n[doctor] that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of weeks on

The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.\n\nToday, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.\n\nThe patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600. He states that his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7, which has been his average for approximately 2 years. The patient checks his blood sugar 2 to 3 times per day and rarely has a blood sugar that goes over 200. He explains that he used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c that at one point was 13. He states that he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it is now.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports a history of diabetic neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient enjoys hiking.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports subjective fever and chills\nRespiratory: Reports cough and shortness of breath with ambulation.\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea and vomiting.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain and right calf cramping.\nSkin: Reports right foot ulcer with yellow foul smelling drainage, and red streaking coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature is slightly elevated.\nVitals are otherwise good.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Edema and pain in calf. Bilateral palpable femoral and papiteal pulses are present. I do not recognize a palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse; however, they are present via Doppler.\nMSK: Examination of the right foot: The necrotic wound on his heel is present. It is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. I do recognize the sloughing of the tissue, as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area, and erythema. An odor is present from the wound. I do not appreciate any bony exposure now. No pain to palpation in the effected area.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis or infection.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.\nDiabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.\n\nIn regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7. We will need to closely monitor his blood sugar since we are going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications depending on the culture results.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on his progress.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that\n[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it\n[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics\n[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left\n[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now\n[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point\n[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that\n[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc\n[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park\n[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now\n[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there\n[patient] i do n't feel that right there\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure\n[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture\n[doctor] correct\n[patient] if i heard\n[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy\n[patient] okay sounds good\n[doctor] alright"}, {"id": "6d2cceecd74846c59ba3ee4d1885fe91", "document": "Patient ID:

I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. \n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nDIALOGUE:\n\n[doctor] hi richard how are you the medical assistant told me that you have a tick bite is that what happened\n[patient] i really

okay\n[patient] yeah blood pressure seems to be doing okay the lisinopril works well\n[doctor] good i was just gon na ask you if you were taking your lisinopril so that's good okay and any side effects from the lisinopril since we started it i think we started it about a year ago two years ago\n[patient] no no no side effects that i'm aware of\n[doctor] no side effects okay and then in terms of your diabetes are you watching your sugar intake\n[patient] yeah i usually watch it the form of high what i'm eating but\n[doctor] i am a big pie fan as well i know what's your favorite type of pie\n[patient] well you know it's favorite boy i just like pie you know apples cherry chocolate you know bicon\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i try to try to avoid the bicon because i think it's just all sugar but i do like it\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] less\n[doctor] i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day\n[patient] not everyday but most of the time\n[doctor] okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly\n[patient] i try to\n[doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or\n[patient] yeah it's definitely running below that\n[doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below\n[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty\n[doctor] good\n[patient] pretty regular\n[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press\n[patient] it's a little bit sore\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all\n[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel\n[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day\n[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so\n[doctor] do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just\n[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this\n[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing\n[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound\n[patient] that's fine\n[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound\n[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues\n[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable\n[patient] okay that'd be good\n[doctor] okay anything else\n[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave\n[doctor] well you know where to find me okay\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] take care bye"}]}
