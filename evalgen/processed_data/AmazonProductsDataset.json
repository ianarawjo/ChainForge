It works wonders!  It clears his skin right up, and it smells good too!  LOVE THIS SOAP! Typical of Yardley, a nicely scented soap that I look forward to using.  I would buy it, or any Yardley soap again (love the lemon and lavender scents too,)  They make me feel refreshed. Great soap with light scent. Decent price. Smells wonderful, great as a skin moisturizer.  Shipped QUICKLY and the price was definitely right.  I will buy this again. I will never order this product again!! This soap makes my skin dry out!!! It smells great though, but smell is not everything.

Little pricey though. No allergens to bother my scalp.  Made my hair soft and full.  I highly recommend this conditioner for anyone with sensitive skin or skin allergies. This company ran by women has made a wonderfully thick and effective non toxic series - this conditioner Ive been using for 10 years since developing an issue with many products after being poisoned.  I simply love this product, my go to hair product.  Many comment on my full head of long grey hair, thick at 62, My wife bought this more for the ingredients than the hair loss factor.<br />She is struggling with hair loss, has not used this product long enough to be able to judge long term change.<br />She has bad allergies to.. Well everything!<br />Being a fragrance free allergen free product this has performed well. With no reactions. It adds quite a bit of volume and fullness. Her hair has not looked so full and thick in several years.<br />This is now her primary goto product at a cost much lower than product we have previously tried. This is a great everyday conditioner for anyone with fine hair. If you need fragrance-free hair products, this is a great brand to buy. I have used the regular shampoo for years, but my store is always out of it.  I looked online and saw there was a conditioner for thinning hair.  I liked this because it seemed thick and it did condition my hair better than other products.  I am pleased with it.  There aren\u2019t many fragrance free conditioners available so it is great to find one that is so good. This conditioner is good in the fact that it doesn't have fragrances, parabens, etc. and is gentle for chemically sensitive, but it is very thin and watery for a conditioner. Desert Organics Fragrance Free is much thicker and better, but more expensive per oz. I guess I will be buying the more expensive one from now on.\n", "\nProduct ID: B001MP47WE\nTitle: Supernail China Silk Wrap, 72 Inch\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nNumber of Ratings: 786\nFeatures: ['Provides added strength and protection', 'Made of 100% pure silk', 'Comes in 72 inch roll']\nDescription: ['Supernail china silk wrap is made from 100% pure silk that provides added strength and protection.']\nPrice: 6.47\nStore: SuperNail\nDetails: {\"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"2 x 4 x 5 inches; 0.63 Ounces\", \"Item model number\": \"51010\", \"UPC\": \"073930510109\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Supernail\"}\nReview Text: Worked fine. This is my first time using plain silk wrap and I love it!  I started using the self adhesive silk tabs to fix cracks and they worked great so I wrapped all my nails but I had to keep buying them. So I upgraded to this. I'm so glad I did. Yes it takes longer to do my nails now but it's so totally worth it. I wrap my nails every week or so and there's still so much of it left! I will not buy anything else, EVER! This product is great for mending broken and cracked nails, but it is a little difficult to cut the silk to the right size. Too thick for me. This silk wrap has been very hard for me to find so I was super excited when I saw it on amazon. It seems everyone has the pre-cut \"stickers\" but it's hard to find the silk strips like these. Product arrived nicely packaged and there is a lot of silk in there but on one of the strips it has been cut and sewed together on a diagonal which means you cannot use that whole area (about 3 inches long), at least not the way I apply my silk. This was disappointing, but the rest of the silk is usable. Used as directed, fell of in 24 hours.  I was hoping to find something to strengthen my nails, as I use them a lot for arts and crafts.  Fake nails damage my nails, so I was hoping this would be an alternative, but now I'll just be using it for...arts and crafts. Does what it says! My daughter uses this to repair broken nails. She loves it Works well. My daughter loves her nails and keeping them long. She also loves basketball and being active. See where this is going? She broke a nail and we used this plus gel polish to repair the nail until the length had grown out. It is strong, thin, easy to use, and sheer enough that it looked natural.\n", "\nProduct ID: B002EV3JBU\nTitle: Stage Blood 4 oz\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nNumber of Ratings: 158\nFeatures: []\nDescription: ['STAGE BLOOD: Graphically real for all genres.

I have always used Ben NYE products for Halloween, and this brand continues to exceed my expectations. Highly recommended.<br />Tip: if you do not want the thick look, just add a teaspoon of water to a small bowl and poor the liquid in with the teaspoon of water. I used a a baby medicine syringe to drip the liquid onto my skin and my costume. Dries daily quick and doesn\u2019t stay tacky. Looks super realistic! Used Halloween worked ok I bought this fake blood for a film where I needed to have the actress spitting blood out into a cup. It worked perfectly. The blood tastes minty but slightly like cough medicine and has a cough medicine after taste to it. It's thick like real blood and certainly looks like real blood. Make sure to brush your teeth after or rinse your mouth out because the red gets all over your teeth. But it's probably the best fake blood on the market. I would definitely buy this again This stage blood works so amazing with skin and latex so no matter the look  you\u2019re going for it\u2019ll work great!!! Highly recommend for special FX makeup or even to prank someone (but don\u2019t say I told you to do it lol). Buy with confidence! I\u2019ve tried many types of stage blood but was never as satisfied as I was with Ben Nye, so I recently decided to go back. Honestly it\u2019s the best out there: Rich, realistic color and pooling; and sticks to skin, liquid latex, and any makeup. Dries quickly but still gives flexibility for dripping or other movement. good quality good taste It came quickly, is a great product, however the cap was split in half then packaged. I can't carry this easily. I love ben nye! Used this for a boudoir shoot. It turned out very good. Blood is realistic and tastes like mint. It didn\u2019t stain either!

It has a nice smell, but it just doesn't work for me. I was relieved to find this product available on Amazon.com.  The quality of the Color-Shield can not be beat by another manufacturer.  Until recently, it was readily available in all stores.  The conditioner is truly lightweight, and leaves the hair with lots of body.  Smells great.  Helps maintain color for weeks. Got this because I dyed my hair blue and needed some sort of sealant to keep from staining everything. Since I started using it the staining has lessened considerably, so I'm pleased. It also has a very light grape scent, which I like. I use about a dime/quarter sized amount and thoroughly massage it though my hair, focusing on the ends. Helps to smooth the hair, and I like that it helps protect hair from UV damage.

Just started using my first bottle and is doing well so far. Subtle scent, with a lovely glow on the skin. I think it is not good for my skin I recently moved to the desert in California and my skin was forever dry. I tried so many different types of lotions to just end up dry and ashy at the end of the day. This oil smells delicious, it has lavender and rosemary and coconut oil. It glides on smoothly and evenly. It is a bit pricey at $8.00 but I pay that for coconut oil anyway. I would not recommend it for your face because it may clog pores because it does have mineral oil that is why I gave it four stars instead of five. It is great for the rest of your body especially your feet. Put some on your feet at night throw on some white tube socks and viola soft feet in the morning. It is great for massage as well.

I received the package 14 days from the day i ordered, so it technically arrived early.. Without considering how crazy inexpensive the tips cost they worked very well, they are more on the &#34;ligh tduty&#34; side. Now overall considering the price you simply cannot beat this! loveddd doing them on myself!<br />Thanks Not as strong as ABS...but more durable after acrylic application....way better way to get those stillettos minus the filling. Worth the price. Since I am just learning the basics of doing nails this makes it easy for me to have fabulous nails! Thank you for making a great and affordable product! When you buy nails they come sizes 0-10. These don't. After such a long wait I was disappointed. Also it's easier to just shape square nails because once to clip them the point is no longer there. Will not be ordering again. Product arrived on time and I am satisfied with the way it was packaged. Perfect for doing my nails in the stiletto shape since it saves me some time in shaping the square tips. I love this. I've wanted stiletto nails for the longest. I found them here for cheap. Only thing I recommend you to so is cut them down a bit. As far as tips go they are exactly that. But most of mine weren't actually stiletto but had the points cracked off. All in all a nice product.  My wife told me however that once she cuts it, the strength of the nail weakens and it breaks more easily.  But once you keep it long it's a good buy.

Bristles are actually pretty soft contrary to what some naysayers are reporting. I was able to whip up a nice, foamy lather with this brush. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and I was able to comfortably use this brush on my face for all three passes. I'd argue that the softness of this brush is on par with entry-level silver tip badger brushes, and it isn't as stiff. The biggest pro is that this brush has no animal smell and doesn't require you to soak it in water. Personally, I prefer a nice soft brush instead of a stiff or rough brush. The only minor con was that there was a chip on the actual finish and the brush is travel size, but I didn't mind it that much. The small size means that it is portable and only takes up little space on my counter. Overall, you're getting a good amount of value for the money here. I highly recommend this brush for budget-conscious buyers as well as folks that are looking for an excellent starter brush. I would say this is a quality product especially for the price. It would not be my choice for a one and only brush because the knot is kind of small and the bristles don't ever splay out like a animal hair or more expensive synthetic brush. The tips of the bristles are nice and soft but the sides are not. Each bristle is shaped like a very tiny curly cue which adds a lot of scrubbing power to it. This is great for loading up soaps and building a lather very quickly but can be a little harsh on the skin if that is a concern for you. If your skin isn't especially sensitive I wouldn't worry about that, in fact I kind of like it for the extra exfoliation. I would recommend this as a travel brush for it's quick drying and if it gets lost or damaged you're not out much money. I bought this synthetic brush for travel because I had read that synthetic brushes dry very quickly.  This is certainly the case, as the brush does air dry within a few minutes.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the very good performance of this shaving brush: it has good backbone for lathering, but the bristles are not scratchy. The loft on this brush is a little tall.  I've found with synthetic brushes the water all comes out to the outside of the brush and they just leak like a sive.  Otherwise the brush works okay.. Bought it for a cheap travel brush, and I'm sure it will be fine for that. Wouldn't buy it for day to day use. I wanted a synthetic for travel, and thought the price was great. This brush exceeded my expectations for two solid weeks straight.\n", "\nProduct ID: B00L173G84\nTitle: 3 LOT Charak Gum Tone Gel (50g x 3)-Herbal astringent and antiseptic to control gingivitis\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nNumber of Ratings: 26\nFeatures: ['3 LOT Charak Gum Tone Gel (50g x 3)-Herbal astringent and antiseptic to control gingivitis']\nDescription: ['* by FedEx;Bleeding, Spongy and Painful Gums (Gingivitis);Prevention of plaque formation and dental caries']\nPrice: 14.99\nStore: Charak\nDetails: {\"Brand\": \"Charak\", \"Item Form\": \"Gel\", \"Item Weight\": \"50 Grams\", \"Unit Count\": \"1.76 Ounce\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"6 x 5.9 x 1.3 inches; 1.76 Ounces\", \"UPC\": \"683405943631\"}\nReview Text: Love this product. It has such a nice fresh taste and makes a great difference to inflamed or bleeding gums. Will definitely order more! I've gone through only 1 tube so far.  When I started using it I was seeing my dentist with some very serious pain and bad conditions with my gums. I hadn't eaten in 2 months due to my teeth feeling loose and my gums were getting multiple abscess that were painful.  It has only been a week and returned to my dentist today and she was AMAZED AT THE CONDITION OF MY GUMS.  She measured my gums today and they showed 50% improvement in one week.  I can see where my gums have grown and my teeth are incredibly stable.  I also used the gum powder with this product because I am excessive in my treatments, but these two products worked.  The insert Gum Tone said that with constant use, your gums will reach a healthy status that your dentist will notice... and today it lived up to  what it said.  This stuff is amazing.

The issue is that virtually all modern TV sets output audio thru a optical connector and are set to Dolby Digital 5.1 by default.  The Tvlink II will not respond to a optical signal with Dolby Digital.  Why??  The Resound Reunite works fine with a Dolby Digital optical signal.<br /><br />So, if your TV allows it, you can go into setup and muck around to change the audio decoding to PCM in order to make the TV link II work.  Unfortunately, many Panasonic and LG TV sets will not allow you to change to force PCM output, so you need to buy a separate decoder.  A high quality decoder is expensive, the cheap ones delay the signal.<br /><br />So, my Tvlink II works with my Samsung TV once I changed the audio format, but not my Panasonic. I got a TV LinK II and streamer when I bought new hearing aids in 2016, but couldn't get it to work with my new Samsung  HD TV, after following all the steps in the user guide book.  Took the Link to the TV store, connected it to one of their TVs, worked fine.  Came home, reconnected, still didn't work.  Persuaded the TV salesman to stop by to fix the problem.  After several attempts, turns out the key was in setting the TV's Audio Format - not to Digital Dobey, but to PCM - which is a kind of universal program.  Bingo!  Optical cable from Samsung OneConnect Digital Output to TV Link Digital Audio Input on back of the base station, and clear, beautiful sounds flowed right in my ears.  This key tip was not in the TV Link User Guide.  The TV Link has improved my viewing and listening immensely.  Would never want to be without it again.  Five stars for the link, 3 or 4 stars for the user guide. Love this no more ear phones for me. Pick the voices from the tv with no problem at all I am only receiving intermittent sound from my unit and the comII has been checked and works fine. Can you help??? You need to know that this unit REQUIRES a Compilot to work, otherwise you have a useless piece of equipment. The webpage only says that it \"can be used\" with all Phonak streamers.  They will NOT take returns and the unit takes some time to get to you because it is being shipped from India. They make it sound like it is based in the US (Hearing Aid Zone). I did not know that it needed the Compilot to work and, now they say I cannot return it. I searched the webpage and did NOT find anything about NO RETURNS. I did do a lot of research beforehand because hearing aids are new to me but did not find anything anywhere that said you needed to spend almost $500 so you could hear the TV.<br />Since, I have found that my hearing aids will connect to a bluetooth TV. I think I can find a smart TV for $500 or less. Works perfect.  I needed an extra base for a second TV. An excellent product that more than met my expectations. The weakest link is the device that makes the connection between it and my  hearing aids . It works well, but  battery has a short charge lifespan and has to be recharged at least once if not twice a day. Returned one because it would not pair. Got a new one and it worked great. Discovered that you must be about a meter away for it to pair so the first failure was my fault. Have only used on tv. great base for my wife's hearing system This is an excellent product.

As many others have commented, it is a temporary effect, the same as you can get with glue.<br /><br />I also got snookered into getting this at a mall kiosk as a few others here have noted in their reviews. Always steer clear of any products where they have a &#34;No Refund&#34; policy. If it's a good product, they will absolutely give you a refund for an UNOPENED and unused product, which is what my case was.<br /><br />But of course, since this is a scam, they would not provide a refund. Listen up, especially my fellow dudes that want to roll back the clock a bit. This is an expensive parlor trick to hide wrinkles as well as bags under your eyes. The substance temporarily tightens your skin with a film that is lightly colored with a Caucasian base make up (at least mine is; maybe they have other shades -- I am in fact a Caucasian male). If you touch it after it dries it will break the seal and you will lose the effect. It only lasts until you wash again or rub the area. I doubt you'd get a full day out of an application.<br /><br />I feel foolish for getting suckered into this expensive product as I was told it would be possible to drop back to weekly for 4 months then put the rest in a freezer for a few years - LOL!<br /><br />If I were a woman that wore a good *spray-based* makeup product over top of it I might think it is worth the money. As a man that doesn't wear make-up, even though the skin tone is close to my own, I think you can easily see I am wearing some sort of cosmetic product.<br /><br />I will probably only use this for web meetings and special occasions and then not buy again. Just OK I'm pretty irritated with myself for falling for this, to be honest. Like most other reviewers, I got suckered into buying this garbage from a pushy sales person at a mall kiosk.  Even as I was recognizing her sales tactics, even with all the red flags, I still bought it. I guess it was just an expensive reminder: don't look a mall kiosk sales person in the eye.\n", "\nProduct ID: B00XLT4QPW\nTitle: 12 Pack of Roll On Empty Glass Bottles for Essential Oils - Refillable Roller Color Roll On - Bulk - 30 ml 1 oz Pack of 12 -Clear Color\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nNumber of Ratings: 44\nFeatures: ['\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc18 \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc05 \ud835\udfd1\ud835\udfce \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0b \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc12: The capacity allows you to store essential oil, finest quality fragrance oil, essence, perfume, or any other liquids that meet your needs of daily care for eyes, faces, and body. 30ml per bottle.

The oil also has antibacterial properties and is high in omega-3 fatty acids. Mustard seed oil has applications in personal care products like massage oils and muscle rubs. While it is often used as a cooking oil in India, its strong aroma is an acquired taste. Mustard seeds, which mustard oil comes from, contain calcium, protein, vitamins A and E, alpha omega-3 and alpha omega-6 fatty acids. They also contain antioxidants; these components make mustard oil an effective hair growth agent. The vitamins ensure strong hair and prevent hair from falling out. Conditioning Because mustard oil contains fatty acids, it both conditions and makes hair stronger, which causes healthy hair growth. Growth Mustard oil encourages the circulation of blood. Mustard oil is a hair stimulant, meaning it causes hair to grow healthier at a faster rate.

If I  were able to give it zero stars I would have Scent is fantastic - but I wish it stayed on longer Doesn\u2019t smell like  Tom Ford tobacco vanillie!! This stuff is great!

My daughter put these on her Christmas wish list, so I bought them for her. They look really cool, and they're sturdy! She loves them, and they'll last a long time! Not the best quality rings but they look cook. they also slip off the fingers easily They fall off my fingers all the time, but they are so pretty! Got these for my daughter, they were on her list for Christmas. Showed up right on time, and exactly as pictured. She hasn\u2019t used them yet, but I know she will love them These do what I wanted them to do, and ultimately I'm ordering another set, but the reason I'm doing that is...the sizes are INSANE.  They range from &#34;large&#34; to &#34;tiny&#34; and the tiny ones are PAINFUL.  They're really rigid metal (which is good, because that means they're durable), but they don't fit like they do in the picture.  I have US average woman's sized hands, and couldn't get my thumb in one and couldn't get my pinky in another, but the ones for my other fingers were too large? O_o? Really sturdy! Wore to a convention all weekend and none of the little gems fell off. Would buy again. Beautiful with my Raven Queen costume. I'm not sure where the seller got their measurements, because my fingers supposedly match their measurements and these were huge! I had to add so much hot glue inside them to get them to fit and I still spent the day worried they would fall off. They look cool, but they do not fit. These are ridiculously sized. Thumb fits... all others are way too big for my teenage daughter. She loved the look so I ordered 2 packs of ring sizers and went to work.\n", "\nProduct ID: B012LNQM2I\nTitle: Rimmel Wonder'Full Wake Me Up Mascara, Extreme Black [003] 0.37 oz (Pack of 3)\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nNumber of Ratings: 33\nFeatures: ['Exclusive formula with Vitamins and Cucumber extract for refreshing look, length and lift', 'Precision brush with soft, lash-hugging fibers smoothly wraps each and every lash', 'Defined, clump free volume', 'Refreshing look, length and lift', '3 Count']\nDescription: ['The first mascara to give your eyes a refreshing look with awakening volume, length and lift!

I really like the simplicity of it yet the shimmers gives a nice touch to my make up. Although, when I received it, it was mushed and scattered up. Much darker color than shown on picture but nice quality eyeshadow. It did not look like what it showed online. It was very light when it came. It look like it was supposed to be darker and that\u2019s what I was expecting I was really disappointed especially since I ordered two. My product arrived broken. I didn't have time to return or find something else since I needed this for a military ball in 2 days. So as seen in the 1st picture I pressed it back together as well as I could.. it was completely crumbled when I opened it but I didn't take a picture since I didn't hesitate for a second to try to fix it.<br />I am upset that I didn't get the product in the way it was promised and for what I paid for. They need to fix however they are handling these shadows and take extra precaution since I know I wasn't the only one received a broken one..<br />Now, as seen in the next 3 images, this is what the shadow looks like on by itself (applied 2 light layers with finger). It's formula is really soft and easy to apply. It looks pretty for a simple everyday look.<br />The last 3 images are what I was able to do in a glam look (less than 5 minutes, ignore my lash not sticking) so, the pigmentation is not as strong as the advertisement makes it seem but it's still a very nice shimmer. There is a different shadow in my inner corner but the rest of the lid is the DGAF on top of regular eyeshadow.<br />I decided to give it 3 stars because of the good formula, the fact it pressed back together so it's still usable, and because you can still get a good look from it, it's a gorgeous color.<br />I would've rated this 5 stars if it wasn't because the product was broken. Shame.<br /><br />Hope this helps.\n", "\nProduct ID: B019PH787Q\nTitle: Avenue Chiett Style Super Hard Spiker Wax - 200ml 4.7oz\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nNumber of Ratings: 59\nFeatures: ['SUPER STRONG HOLD - Avenue Chiett Spiker Wax holds hair exactly in the style you want with minimum usage.

This is my first time using super hard wax so my comment may lack some credibility, but I wasn't too impressed. Once you style your hair and the wax hardens, there's no more room for improvement. And once hair hardens, I feel like the thinness of the hair is more exposed. And I get scared when I try to brush through my hair because it feels like hair can fall off if I brush hard. I bought it style my longer look but now I'm thinking of cutting my hair short and then using the wax. Again, I never used super hard wax before so my view may be skewed. I've been trying to find the perfect one that can hold my hair, not make it too hard and look natural. This easily holds my hair up in any style. Korean cosmetics/accessories are the best, they really know their stuff. Between this and the pink Gatsby, this one holds better. second time to purchase this wax. i have been use many different brand of wax. this is the only one i use now. very strong hold, and very easy wash it off. My husband is only used it for years.<br /> It doesn't have a strong scent. It's nice. My hair is pretty hard, but it holds  And it\u2019s not shiny.  I really like it.  Bought 3 of them.

I learned some things when I was looking for hair cutting shears. Mostly that you can pay around $200 for the best ones,used by professionals,and,that you need very sharp scissors or shears to cut or trim hair.<br /><br />I've been trimming and shaping my own hair for a long time and am usually happy with the results,considering too many times,when I would go to a salon to have it cut or shaped or trimmed,they did a job I was almost always disappointed with. I decided a long time ago,if someone was going to screw up my hair,it might as well be me. At least I have a good idea on when to stop cutting it and I actually care what the final result looks like.<br /><br />I also have fine,wavy hair. Not the easiest to cut.<br /><br />I have noticed,and maybe it was from using whatever scissors were around at the time,that sometimes the ends do look a bit frazzled;and in researching shears,I found out that unless the blades are very sharp,the ends can break,or result in split ends. I don't have split ends and never noticed them,except for a long,long time ago when I was a teenager;but,I have used these once to do some light trimming and shaping;with wavy hair you are always shaping,cutting with the wave and not cutting against the wave. And,these shears have produced a nice result. And I don't see the somewhat frazzled or lightningbolt effect at the ends of my hair,that I sometimes get.<br /><br />I've used these just once,I only trim my hair to maintain healthy looking ends,and I did it a few weeks ago,and I like these and I'm glad I looked for something better than &quot;any old scissors&quot; that I have on hand. I am not a professional beautician, but because I cut my own hair I like to use professional tools. After watching a YouTube video, the professional recommended purchasing his Invisiblade shears, but they were much too expensive for me. I went on Amazon to see if I could find a similar pair at a better price and I did. I read the reviews for Mosher Salon Tools Thinning Shear & took a chance on my purchase. I am very glad I did because these shears have a nice weight & they are SHARP. I've used them once so far, but I'll be using them for each of my haircuts in the future. [[VIDEOID:fe56c1c7b2c296937aad5f5e7284457c]] ***As a licensed cosmetologist, I am writing this review from a personal AND professional standpoint****<br /><br />I really like these shears, and think they will work amazingly for a student, or anyone who needs a backup pair. I think its unique and awesome that the company who makes these have specialized in sharpening services for a long time. It definitely shows! They are well made, they are well weighted and the little jewel is a cute accent to the shears.

If you push too hard the machine will basically stop.

It's so easy to use that I can do it almost without looking while watching TV.<br /><br /> I like the extension handle, particularly because it catches the powdered skin that comes out the holes on the device's underside. I just empty it into a small garbage can periodically as I go. The handle also makes it nice to reach around the far side of my foot since I am definitely not a contortionist. Make sure you firmly snap the device under the ridge that holds it into the extension handle: then it holds it nice and snug.<br /><br />Overall, a nice little device. Reasonable price, too. I had seen this demonstrated several years ago, so when I had need for one, I tried it. It takes your old tired rough feet and makes them smooth as a baby's butt.

I also like that you get more than one becuase this allows for experimentation- I took one of the donuts and cut it so that it is now one long spongy tube that I use to make the bouffant and beautifully giant French Twist (think Cate Blanchett in The House With a Clock in its Walls). So if you  want your hairdo large and sturdy this is a great choice. Five stars. Fast and easy hair do for my seven year old daughter in the mornings. She loves trying new things with her hair and there are tons of ways to use these magic hair donuts!\n", "\nProduct ID: B01G5ZLIO0\nTitle: Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser Combo, Black\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nNumber of Ratings: 124\nFeatures: ['Our most popular water flosser', '90 seconds of water capacity', 'Ten pressure settings', '3-year warranty on Ultra', 'Tip rotates 360 degrees on cordless']\nDescription: ['Brand new in box combo pack with 12 tips, 1 ultra water flosser, 1 cordless plus water flosser, 2 deluxe travel case. 3 years manufacturer warranty.']\nPrice: 149.99\nStore: Waterpik\nDetails: {\"Brand\": \"Waterpik\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Special Feature\": \"Multiple Pressure Settings, Multiple Tips\", \"Unit Count\": \"1 Count\", \"Color\": \"Black\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"11.6 x 10.6 x 5.7 inches; 3.75 Pounds\", \"Item model number\": \"SG_B01G5ZLIO0_US\", \"UPC\": \"073950211864\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Waterpik\"}\nReview Text: great This is not actually like the big bulky Waterpiks that I remember.  It's just the right size and it's a dual combo...it also comes with the portable Waterpik that you can take with you when you travel (dual voltage).  UPDATE:  I loved this flosser so much that I recommended it to my brother and discovered that the other models have an on/off button on the device handle.  This feature would be a nice to have as this model you have to depress the button and hold it to keep the water from spraying out when you are moving it back to the base holder and transitioning to turn the unit on or off. Works good.  Small unit.  Sometimes need to add water to finish flossing. The best oral item you will ever buy. Pretty powerful and the portable one is convenient for travel... Can really tell the difference between this and flossing... Great products for both home use and travel. Highly recommend! I'm so glad I purchased this! I definitely feel the difference with my teeth. I have braces so this helps with keeping my gums healthy. Good product I got this as a gift to replace my old Waterpik flosser.

The Latte Confession color is a bit darker and redder (I was hoping for a clay / pink) but it is an amazing product.  Stay power is wonderful even with drinking and eating.  I only need to reapply once after the initial application.  Pigmentation is strong also.  You truly get a great product for the value.  I purchased rose garden (the color is a bit brighter and neon pinker than I wanted) and just ordered innocent vixen too.  This is HUGE because I can never buy more than one of a lipstick because I don't truly love it.  Just a small note: it is a matte lipstick so it does dry my lips out a little.  I moisturize at night and I'm good to go.  It's also very easy to take off at the end of the day (no scrubbing or rubbing). I like it, but even if you apply a small amount your teeth will be brown la Splash lipsticks are great. Found out about them on YouTube Like the company, I personally did not like the shade.  Too bright pink for a middle-aged\u200b lady. I love the formula of these. They are comfortable and long-wearing, which is a rarity in liquid mattes. The smell is pretty horrid (like paint) but goes away once it dries. This particular color (latte) is a very grey-toned, pale nude which is unfortunately unflattering on me in natural light. I am very fair-skinned with pink undertones and my boyfriend legitimately thought I was having breathing problems because my lips looked blue. Even though this shade didn't work for me I would absolutely try others in this line. This lipstick in Retro Bettie is a MUST HAVE for my beauty regimen as a jazz singer. I have to put my face on about an hour before I get to a gig, which is an hour before it starts, and it lasts 3 hours: so I need a lipstick that can last a minimum of 5 hours. THIS IS THAT LIPSTICK!<br /><br />It goes on smooth, and the tip is like a typical lip gloss applicator. But it is not forgiving (it will temporarily stain your regular skin if you're not careful!), it is forever. Once you put it on just hang out with your mouth open for 30 seconds for it to seal in, and then you're good to go, with drinks and everything, for at least my usual 5-hour stint.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this lipstick does smudge off, or even wash off: it flakes off. Which is kind of amazing since I don't use makeup remover: I just rub my lips against each other, or rub them with a paper towel or washclothes and the whole thing comes off easily.<br /><br />NOTE: Your lips will feel dry by the end of the night because they will be, but you CANNOT add a lip gloss or chapstick atop this lipstick or it will completely lose its efficacy as a stay-put product: it will move around and stain everything\u2014I learned this the hard way.<br /><br />Almost every pic on my Instagram (@ojanmarie) has me wearing this excellent shade, which is a true red, on the slightly blue-red side, but not bright like a tomato, much deeper and more saturated than that. It will go on your lips a lighter shade and will dry darker, just FYI.<br /><br />Good luck using my fav product!!! I love it, although it does smear if it gets wet. This is a great product, works as advertised, and the color is wonderful. It stays on really well. I am very happy about that. It is a little dull though and makes your lips look a little dry. Other than that it was pretty good I love LA Splash lipsticks.  They last and you only need one swipe of the wand to get full coverage color.  They can feel very dry on the lips, but I don't mind that.\n", "\nProduct ID: B072N95X6P\nTitle: Vanilla by Body Fantasies, 3 Pack 8 oz Fragrance Body Spray for Women\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nNumber of Ratings: 592\nFeatures: []\nDescription: [\"Body Fantasies Signature Vanilla by Parfums de Coeur is a Floral Fruity Gourmand fragrance for women launched during the 2000's.

I bought white and it didn't cover up my dark brown beard very well. Works nicely.  Thank you Works as advertised, but you need a lot to make your hair as white as the images they are showing as examples.<br /><br />I have short black hair, so take that into consideration, as black is difficult to get a full white coverup.<br />But when styling my hair with regular wax, I use about 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon for styling.<br /><br />To get white coverage with this wax, I need to use 3-5 times that much of this product.<br /><br />Also - it's cool to know that it's actually just zinc oxide they use for the white coloring - safe sunscreen mineral. The white product turns dark hair a shiny grey color, which is exactly what I was looking for. If you are looking to go grey and you have dark brown or black hair, I would recommend you try the white. This probably would not work on long hair. It looked awesome on the top of my hair (sides of my head are shaved with about 3 inches of hair on top). Great look for new year's parties, costume parties or just a week's worth of temporary hair changes. I would not use it long term but it's a fun short term product. It will get glitter on your pillow if you try and sleep with it in. Goes on wet; you have to use a large amount. It will dry and then you will be able to touch it, but otherwise it will get all over your hands and forehead.  The good news is it's very easy to remove with one rinse of just water, both from skin and hair. Makes your hair very stiff and somewhat difficult to style, but I made it work by slicking it back with a comb. Not exactly like the viral videos, but I got lots of compliments and had fun!<br /><br />This is just my experience with the product, please let me know if my review helped by clicking below! Love it. I have black hair with a few silver hairs at the temples, so I bought this to accentuate it. I'd planned to put s few more permanent silver streaks in my hair, but I'm happy that I bought this instead: it washes out easily if I don't quite get the effect I want. I was able to put in very natural silver streaks. The effect is subtle on darker hair, but it beautifully enhanced my gray temples.<br />The product arrived well ahead of time & was well packaged. It smells nice, and it easily washes out.<br />One caveat: it is water soluble. If you live in a hot or humid place, or you perspire easily, it could run a bit if your hair gets wet.<br />I'd definitely buy it again. I'm curious about the other colors. This product is SOLID. I got to try out what my hair would look like in the gray-ish color before actually dyeing it.<br /><br />I've wanted this color for so long, but I have a tan/beige skin complexion which a lot of lighter colors don't suit, so I was apprehensive about doing it. I got to use this product to try it out and get some opinions and now that I know that I loved it and everyone else loved it, I can dye my hair without fear. That means this product was MORE than worth it.<br /><br />Also when applying the cream, initially it makes my hair feel a bit stiff, as would any leave-in creme based products so that's not unreasonable to expect. But after a few minutes the stiff feeling was gone and my hair returned to its natural form and shape, which really allowed me to gauge how I looked with this colored hair.<br /><br />Overall this is a solid 5/5 experience and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />My hair type is long thick black hair of asian origin. I know some people have been wondering if it works on &#60;x&#62; type of hair, so I thought i would include that information. Did not come close to working in my long dirty blonde hair. Maybe if you have dark shirt hair it would be better? Does not work at all Absolutely Horrendous. (-: This is by far the worst item I have ever purchased on amazon. I was under the impression that it would make my hair look white and be easy to work with, like the photos. oh no, no no no no. it was sticky, stuck into my hair like hair gel, looked wet/greasy, and was impossible to brush in. first I did a little bit at a time with no luck, and then a lot of it.

It looks just like my natural skin when applied. I purchased my Aeroblend system in November, and it's Wonderful! Since November, I have tried Luminess, Belloccio, and Aeroblend foundations. I had hoped I would like Belloccio because it's half the price, but it could not compare to the Aeroblend Foundation.  The Luminess was too sticky, like it never set. The Aeroblend looks Absolutely Flawless. It takes minutes to do my makeup now, and so many people have asked me about my skin. I am so glad I purchased my Aeroblend system! I ordered this for my 16 year old granddaughter and she LOVES it. She said her makeup is sooooo awesome with this that she hates to take it off. She had a luminess airbrush and it was difficult to clean and would put dots of makeup on her face instead of a nice smooth finish. This one is amazing. Large bottle.  Great color match. Secure bottle. I'm 100% happy!<br />After reading the reviews I was excited to try this. WoW!  I purchased the Luminous kit previously & at first was excited but the bottles were small and they always leaked (in shipping & in my cabinet). This color was a perfect match for my light (not pale) skin. I use with my Luminous air system and LOVE it! This will be my go to! I was use to the small bottle, and I managed to spill the liquid twice.........if your used to the small bottles do something that you don't make the same mistake I did twice. And so much bigger than the original sample bottles I had with my machine I purchased this system and the first container was great. This one is full of lumps and will not blend. Even after shaking for almost 10 minutes.  It plugged up the tip and now I am unable to use the foundation.  Seriously disappointed. This is the lightest, most long-wearing foundation I've ever used. Period. And with mature (52) skin which tends to be dry, I'm not left with unsightly creases at the end of the day either. I use the Aeroblend airbrush to apply this in the morning and it looks great literally all day long! Despite having sensitive skin, this makeup has not caused a single breakout to date. It also doesn't feel like I'm wearing a mask - goes on light and stays that way. Highly recommend. I have never ordered this brand so I thought i\u2019d Get it a try especially for the price of the size bottle you get.  I ordered two different colors since I wasn\u2019t sure and this one N20 was a perfect match for my skin.  You also use less of this than the Luminess I have always purchased.  This is what I will use from now on. Great makeup but thinner than I\u2019m used to so I had to adjust, will buy again, better price. I like to buy a very light and very dark in airbrush makeup so I can mix any shade in between. The problem with this product is it cant be back bubbled. It just created a bunch of bubbles. To mix it you have to mix in a separate container and then pour it into the airbrush. Sadly I bought a bunch of light when it was on sale around Christmas so Im stuck with it for now. Another big issue with this brand that I havent experienced with any other airbrush makeup is that it settles really bad and you have to shake it vigorously for quite a while before it mixes. I have never had a product that required this much shaking. The color is decent but tends to rub off easily. I have to be extra careful not to touch my face.\n", "\nProduct ID: B07B6TNHTD\nTitle: Traxxas TRA8073 Mirrors, side, black (left & right)/ retainers (2)/ body clips (4)\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nNumber of Ratings: 36\nFeatures: ['Traxxas 8073 - Side Mirrors, Black, TRX-4', 'Features: Black Plastic', 'Includes: (1) Left Mirror (1) Right Mirror (2) Retainers (4) Body Clips', 'Specs:', 'Part number(s) included (in factory packaging): 8073']\nDescription: ['Mirrors, side, black (left & right)/ retainers (2)/ body clips (4)']\nPrice: 9.26\nStore: Traxxas\nDetails: {\"Auto Part Position\": \"Left\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"0.5 x 3 x 5 inches\", \"Lens Curvature Description\": \"Convex\", \"Material\": \"Plastic\", \"Brand\": \"Traxxas\", \"Mounting Type\": \"Headrest Mount\", \"Item Weight\": \"0.02 Pounds\", \"Operation Mode\": \"Manual\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"0.5 x 3 x 5 inches; 0.32 Ounces\", \"Manufacturer recommended age\": \"14 months and up\", \"Item model number\": \"8073\", \"UPC\": \"020334807304\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Traxxas\", \"Country of Origin\": \"China\"}\nReview Text: I like the way it looks but the fake mirror stickers are goofy.

I haven\u2019t been able to find the brand in stores since Claire\u2019s shut down, my earrings were pulled out years ago and I never thought I\u2019d be able to wear earrings again, lobe wonders are durable long lasting and reliable. However I recommend if wearing a heavy earring use two of the lobe wonders, I only were one as I normally only wear diamond studs but if I must were dangling earrings I use two. Also, even if you don\u2019t have a situation where your ear lobes are completely split they truly help hold your earrings up without putting stress on your piercings. I have bought these for years.  They are an excellent value at Amazon and work great. I LOVE THESE!!!! When I was in Jr. High (over 40 years ago) I had the hole in my pierced ear ripped & over the years it has gotten increasingly worse. I could never where stud earrings or small earrings because they would literally go through the hole in my ear until I discovered these about 6 years ago & I have used them ever since. These worked exactly as they are supposed to:) it does not work for big earrings as in the pisture it shows small earrings.tried two still did not work.stuck with the was<br />te of money don't pay to ship back,glad I bought the smaller package. They don't stick long...and they come off easily.  They are a good size and are clear.<br />They just need more adhesicivness. I have a torn earlobe ( torn all the way to the end) I wouldn't be able to wear earrings without these! If you clean the back of your earlobe with rubbing alcohol beforehand it will make these stay on for about a week, maybe two.

He ran out and I missed the smell, so I ordered more. However... One of these things is not like the other. Or rather, one of these things is like both...<br /><br />The left bottle is a genuine bottle of One Million Lucky, the center bottle is what I just received, and the right bottle is One Million.<br /><br />The bottle I just received.... Notice the one on the left has the chrome/gold front and clear glass? The one on the right has a gold front and amber glass? Hm. The one in the center has the chrome/gold front.... But amber glass??? It also smells nothing like Lucky. It definitely smells more of the regular One Million.<br /><br />I have reordered and only HOPE this is an isolated incident and I get the correct thing this next time.<br />-----<br />I rec'd the bottle I reordered today, and thankfully everything seems to be legit with it and I can resume sniffing my husband. Smells great.<br /><br />I usually use 2 squirts, with Sauvage and Chanel. With Lucky I need 3 for the staying power.<br /><br />I was worried about all the fakes online, but I took my bottle to Macys - 100% LIGIT.<br /><br />3/4 hour projection then need to reapply, reason I gave 4 Stars but I totally love this fragrance! I bought this Cologne as a Christmas Gift for my Son; He chose the type of Cologne, but of course I wanted to get a good deal and not pay Department Store prices!  I'm always worried about buying products like this online, but the Cologne seemed to be the real thing and he was very happy with it...so let's call it a good deal. Excellent perfume 100 percent authentic, fully recommended. we purchased the little one for traveling - and it is truly a great smelling mens cologne which we'd read about then ordered a tester on - then this purchase.  Give it a try you won't be disappointed.

I really like the material, easy clean, easy wash & dry. Excellent for grooming my dogs, hair slides off the material & clothes are totally protected. It easily works for men or women & the sizing is as listed. If I had one negative, I would prefer Velcro closures rather than the snaps, which are a bit tough to open & close if you have arthritis in the thumbs or hands. Otherwise, it\u2019s a great addition to anyone who grooms animals at home but doesn\u2019t want to be covered in hair or snag good clothing. FYI: I wear a size L/XL blouse & the grooming shirt is big on me but fits my 6\u20193\u201d husband just fine. ITEM as described. But don\u2019t use it much. I wear size 14, this wouldn't fit well enough to snap below the waist. The material is slick and not too heavy. Great fit, length and like that you can roll the sleeves and secure them. Only downfall it shows every drop of anything that gets on it. I guess it would be perfect if was black Wish is bigger size I do fit in this one but people @ Wk not The material is perfect but it's cut out with men's proportions, women need something more synched at the waist and loose on the hips...so since it was straight cut it held my hips very snug, pass. This smock is very comfortable and stylish. Keeps spray from soaking my clothes, but not completely waterproof. That would be too hot to work in.

This product is nice. I just started using it. I'm trying to see if it makes my hair thicker since it thinned out a lot . Love arrived faster than expected arrival date I love the way my hair feels when using shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and miracle drops. I find my hair doesn\u2019t feel dry like other popular products and I have already started to see growth after only two weeks. This is very good for hair growth see results in 2 weeks I\u2019ve been using kaleidoscope for a while now and at the time I had some hair loss but I started to use the kaleidoscope drops the regular brand because I\u2019ve noticed the extra strength growth drops were too strong all of the products for kaleidoscope are great to shampoo the conditioner it smells really good it\u2019s minty on your scalp, And the next best thing is the conditioner milk with rice water is very nice This was a huge disappointment. The shampoo totally burned my eyes and unclogged my sinuses and my drain. Lol. This stuff smells awful. I had a flashback to wash day as a girl with the sulfur eight hair grease. Not a good memory. This stuff is loaded with chemicals and I will not be repurchasing. The shampoo alone turned me off from trying the serum. No way!!! Love this product, hair so soft and i am seeing progress in the growth of my hair. Wife loves it Will it again.

He started using it and now he uses it every day to make himself feel more secure about his belongings. Originally I left a bad review about it not locking, but I realized soon after that I just wasn't turning the key far enough because I thought the resistance I was meeting was the end of the lock turn.<br /><br />After trying a few times I realize now it was my error in assuming the item was faulty and I am now correcting my review to rate it properly.<br /><br />The Case is sturdy with a decent lock on it. I do wish it was a slightly different design as the lock although it does in fact lock it seems weak and anyone with any time on their hands could easily snap it probably with just a butter knife. Which I hope doesn't happen as I bought this item specifically to protect my make up from the greedy grubby hands of my own family since I had high end make up stolen from my current non locking case.<br /><br />I do recommend this item for light protection of products and belongings but nothing more than that.<br /><br />Cute design is definitely a selling feature. After spending literally hours searching Amazon (and target, and wal-mart, and ebay...) for the perfect train case to hold my cosmetics, I finally found it! It has all the features I was looking for: hard case, brush holders in the lid, and adjustable dividers. As a cherry on top, the case also has a lock on it, which is so handy if you have kids who want to play with your makeup or a teen that wants to &#34;borrow&#34; it.<br /><br />This case features a simple, classic black fabric exterior and pretty pink lining. Its spacious interior will make you want to buy more cosmetics! Good value at $14/ea. I needed a soft bag or case that held its shape. So this met my needs. I found the internal pouches to be more of a nuisance than useful. If they were clear pouches, I may have used these. However the bulk of the pouch itself does take up valuable space. One side of the case has a mesh pocket which can easily hold small items. This is great for the nightstand or traveling. (Just don't leave it locked at the airport. TSA might have an uncomfortable conversation with you...but at least you'll have a funny story to tell when you get to your destination!) When I ordered this, I thought it was going to be a lot bigger than what it is. But over all it's a cute little makeup box. I store all of my lash collection in it I bought this to carry my medications in for to and from the doctor's office. The inside walls are removable making this perfect for what I needed it for. I would buy another is they had other patterns I liked Love it ! Came as described. I am very pleased and i will purchase another one of their styles. Worth it and came fast ! Plenty of room and does not weigh alot empty.

I recommend it New Balance is a popular brand in our home. My husband & sons wear NB shoes because they're so comfortable. The same quality applies to this headband. It has a good stretch to fit larger heads, the seams are sewn in tight & neatly, and the material is soft. Another great product from New Balance! This New Balance Unisex Grid Fleece Headband is super soft and stretchy.<br /><br />I like that it is contoured to fit well around my ears and forehead.  Great fabric that is soft and also breathable.  It has a slight pattern to it that looks great.  It is the perfect weight for colder weather without being bulky or uncomfortable.  Moisture wicking and antimicrobial treatment to keep it smelling great too!<br /><br />Quality product, by a quality company, at a very reasonable price.  Pick one up today! This is a nice athletic headband/ear warmer. The black looks nice and the fabric is smooth and soft to touch, not at all irritating on the skin or face. It\u2019s not very thick\u2026So definitely more of an athletic style versus a cold-weather essentials style. I am able to wear it with my hair pulled back in a ponytail or with my hair down, and it definitely does a good job of keeping my ears sealed in from the wind and cold while outdoors walking my dog. I will say though that I have a pretty medium-sized head for a female, and while it fits me ok, I wouldn\u2019t want it much tighter, so those with known larger heads may want to beware of a potentially tight fit. This is a great, lightweight headband. It's stretchy enough that it fits my head comfortably & my boyfriend's head as well. The fleece lining on the inside is a nice touch, it's warm but not so thick that you'd be unable to hear. This is perfect for those Fall/Winter months, especially if you don't want to wear a full hat. This headband fits perfectly. I'm in North Florida, so it still gets relatively cold here. I walk every day, so the colder weather can make it a little difficult. This headband is just the right about of thickness for weather in the 40-50 degree area. It does a great job of keeping my ears warm without overheating. The sleek black design goes great with any outfit as well. This will definitely keep my ears warm during the winter. I don't live in a very cold place, so when I say it keeps my ears warm that may not be the same for someone in snow. It's large and I wasn't a fan of wearing it with my hair down, but I would absolutely wear it with my hair up in a bun. Good fit. Great color. Not too warm so I would not recommend this to be worn on a winter run. This headband is great for when I go out on my daily runs! It\u2019s lightweight and fits my head comfortably, it never falls or slips off while I\u2019m running. It\u2019s easy to take on and off and never stretches too big. The material feels nice, it also does a good job of wicking moisture and keeps dry from sweat while running. I like how the logo is reflective, that\u2019s a nice touch. I wear it on all my runs, it\u2019s convenient and comfy! I ordered this for my 16 yr old daughter to keep her ears warm while playing lacrosse since we are still getting snow!! But I ended up returning it because it was massive. It didn\u2019t stay on her while being still (on me either) and there is absolutely no way it would have worked while running around on the field during practice. A bit disappointing since I bought the band and gloves to match since she is kind of weird about that kind of stuff.\n", "\nProduct ID: B08378WVBJ\nTitle: SSEN CLIPS (Large/ 8 clips) (Rainbow)\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nNumber of Ratings: 36\nFeatures: ['Sectioning Clips for Hair Stylists', 'No Stain and Discoloration', 'Able to use with Chemicals for Perm and Dye', 'Durable and long lasting', 'No Slip']\nDescription: ['Hair Clips for hairdressers']\nPrice: 35.99\nStore: SSEN CLIPS\nDetails: {\"Brand\": \"SSEN CLIPS\", \"Hair Type\": \"All\", \"Color\": \"Rainbow\", \"Age Range (Description)\": \"Adult\", \"Unit Count\": \"8.00 Count\", \"Manufacturer\": \"SSEN BEAUTY\"}\nReview Text: Great for think hair Love these clips!! Strong hold and does not snag the hair. The owner stopped by my salon in Dallas to show us her clips and a few of us decided to buy some. I can not say enough great things about them. I have two different sizes and love both. Incredible quality, no hair pulling, easy for sectioning. Absolutely get them!!! I really like this clip.  Very well made. Strong grip.  Easy to open.  It holds heavy thick hair very well, the design is nice.  The clip is strong but not bulky.  I received this as a sample from the maker and can recommend it!  I am excited to buy more. I\u2019ve been doing here 15 years and my family\u2019s been in the industry for 92. I have never seen clips this high quality and they can hold the heaviest hair! Love love love thank you so much for this great product This product is awesome!! I tried so many different kinds and I finally got the best one. It holds my hair very tight despite my hair volume. And it never broke and very strong plastic and wire. I rarely leave a product review but this made me amazed and satisfied!! BEST clips I have ever used. The designer came by my salon and gave me one as a sample, I immediately ordered some! They hold so much hair and don\u2019t slide!! I will never use another brand. Do not hesitate to order these! I have been styling hair since 1982.  (That is a long time ago!) I have seen many new clips come and go but I have always had my clear and few favorite clips I would have success with.<br /><br />I have always weaved hair color for many services. A sturdy clip that is secure when it is holding the hair, but inserts and retracts easily is a must. Especially clips need to NOT disturb the foil or pull the hair.<br /><br />I have loved these SSEN clips since the first time I used them. They are truly the perfection of all hair clips. My search for the exact right clip is complete.  All of the eight exciting colors of SSEN clips are welcome in my business anytime.<br /><br />They sanitize easily and really are made well so they last and last.<br />I have never written a review for hair clips; however, I truly could not have a higher recommendation and opinion of these SSEN clips.<br /><br />\u2764\ufe0f\u262e\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f<br />Kathleen\n", "\nProduct ID: B083TPC3HN\nTitle: Easy Hair Coloring, mise en scene Hello Bubble Foam Color Dark Brown [3NT Dark Choco], Self Care DIY Hair Coloring Amore Pacific\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nNumber of Ratings: 61\nFeatures: []\nDescription: ['Easy Hair Coloring, mise en scene Hello Bubble Foam Color Dark Brown [3NT Dark Choco], Self Care DIY Hair Coloring Amore Pacific.']\nPrice: 12.5\nStore: Mise En Scene\nDetails: {\"Package Information\": \"Box\", \"Brand\": \"Mise En Scene\", \"Item Form\": \"Foam\", \"Hair Type\": \"Normal\", \"Number of Items\": \"1\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"7.5 x 3.6 x 3.3 inches; 8.78 Ounces\", \"UPC\": \"759245743004\"}\nReview Text: Great I thought it was just one faulty box out of the 3 but I was wrong.

I like this brand but i know people diss it and call it watered down. I never had a problem, but, also dont get coverage from any brand in one coat, not this good. Its a very smooth constantly, which reminds me of OPI or Essie. This particular color is a nice transition from the neons of summer, to the darker, fall weather, shades. But i recommend the brand and color This is not a red, rather a brownish pink. :( I was very excited to get this one but pretty disappointed now.

I found these temporary teeth on Amazon.  I just pull one that fitted right out of the package and snapped it in place without glue or any other type of adhesive.  It stays in until I take it out.  I can eat soft food with it in.  When I want to eat something with a hard texture, I just slip the tooth out right in public and no one notices.  When I finish eating, I just snap it back in place while holding a napkin to my mouth and no one notices that I\u2019m putting my tooth back in.  This is absolutely a perfect solution until my partial arrives.  SEE MY VIDEO.  Now,  I\u2019m going to order back teeth just to see how they work since they\u2019re only $7 plus change.  I\u2019m excited to try the back teeth\u2026just curious to see if they will work as good as the front teeth.  I\u2019ll have my partial soon, so if the back ones don\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t matter since people can\u2019t see the back teeth that are out that well. NOT a single #6 (Upper Right) Cuspid out of 140 teeth!!<br />Plenty of #11 (Upper Left) Cuspids but ZERO #6\u2019s. I was able to find the perfect size tooth and glue it in using some denture adhesive. Saved me from total embarrassment while I waited for dental treatment. Good value for the cost but you will need some better glue.<br />The teeth, are huge, my front teeth dont compare to how big these are .<br />Searching for a smaller size i ended up sanding it down and applying crazy glue, not reccomended i was just desperate Does not work I do not recommend. These are a joke and waste of money. They do not look like real teeth at all I lost a 40 year old  incisor Crown when it dropped out whilst in the shower and it disappeared down the drain.

After giving birth, I made a witch hazel spray for healing, I made a tea tree toner to soothe skin during breakouts, and I made a room spray with lavender and eucalyptus to keep in the room with the diaper changers. It's great that this comes in a set of three and that the sprayers put out a fine mist rather than a thick set of droplets. I also really like the cobalt blue color. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own. I needed the sprayers for some Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus because Avon did not provide them and it is a huge mess trying to apply the oil without them. These sprayers  fit the SSS bottles and they spray the oil in a fine mist. Perfect. works as stated! I ordered spray bottles, and my bottles were flip top and not spray bottles at all.  However, I am keeping them as I can use them for travel and everyday. Sprays a fine mist and I use it daily for cologne. Received with no issues or damage and perfect for it's intended use They feel heavy duty, test will be when I travel next. It will be great to have everything that looks together when you travel These are very nice bottles! I use them for my DIY hairspray, bug spray & sunscreen spray. I like them! I ordered a spray bottle but received a regular bottle with no sprayer.  Totally useless. Tops screw on well with no leaks. Fine mist and pretty blue plastic.

It appears to be real and the colors are nice, though not the most pigmented and all a bit light. Still love the palette- great for pastel, dreamy looks! Love the colors and great pigment. I love the pigment of this pallete. It\u2019s so pretty with vibrant pastel colors. It\u2019s a bit pricey compared to colourpops website, but you do get it faster. Loved the pallete the only issue I can state I had was the lack of pigment in some of the shadows. Regardless with some concealer applied on it works. The box was a little damaged when arrived. Also one of the eyeshadow plates were popping out. I bought this because colourpop doesn\u2019t sell this on their website anymore.

These were for my sons Among us theme party. I did not have time to contact seller or return because I needed them right away. I still used them, but not what I wanted. Plus the plastic protection top comes off very easily. The tattoos themselves were fine, they applied easily. These were high quality. Looked great bright color These were perfect. My son absolutely adored these. The tattoos seem nice, we haven\u2019t actually used any yet. Bought them to give out as birthday party favors. But some of the tattoos shown are not in the package, we got different ones instead. Which I\u2019m ok with, just a heads up for anyone else. Not all the tattoos pictures were in the package. We received emergency meeting tattoos instead of the ones with the 2 crewmates and a gun. Which is ok because I wasn\u2019t going to give those out anyway!

From what I can tell, it seems to do this, but not in a dramatic fashion. The ingredients include Almond Oil, Cocoa Seed Butter, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Urea, Peppermint Oil, Menthol, and Colloidal Silver. As others have pointed out, the cream spreads easy enough but doesn't seem to absorb that well into the skin. Also, the dinky-sized jar only contains 2-ounces. So, you'll probably go through the bottle fairly quickly if you follow the instructions and apply liberally. It's a decent foot cream overall but seems a little pricey for the small amount you get. I use anti-fungal cream on my feet to keep the skin moist and lubricated, and cure or prevent fungal infections including athlete foot. Silver is naturally anti-bacterial and anti-fungal, so I got this small jar (2 oz). It has a faint minty fragrance.<br /><br />You could use something like this anywhere on the body, of course, but it is quite greasy. A little goes a long way. After a shower, I apply it to my entire foot and ankle, paying attention to get it between the toes and around the nails, and then I put on clean socks.<br /><br />It\u2019s working for me. This is great on the winter heels, I apply it at night and use my moisturizing sock and over the course of a week have found my feet become softer with less flaky dead skin, it's very moisturizing and hydrating applying after a foot bath or a shower. My heels are really dry - what I could describe as 'hoof-y' - so I use creams/treatments to keep the skin from feeling uncomfortably tight and super rough.  This foot cream is effective on making my heels feel more comfortable plus I'm using this cream on my entire feet.  This cream has a peppermint scent which I find invigorating so it's good I use this in the morning before putting on my socks.  I don't have any problem with foot odor so I cannot evaluate that.  This is a thick cream that absorbs quite quickly on my poor dry feet. I apply, wait a minute or so, and then pull on my socks as I want the cream to soak into my feet and not my socks.  My rating is 5 stars for I'm entirely happy with this foot cream, how it absorbs, and its effectiveness. [[VIDEOID:29f672525b29e6a29c81244cde21aa93]] Well packed Greasy stuff, not my cup of tea, but my wife she is OK with, so no waste here for this free for a review cream. Otherwise my wife says : IT WORKS! Returned item unopened . Ounces were small fir price . The Silver Miracles Colloidal Silver Foot Cream isn\u2019t just for feet. The antibacterial priorities make it excellent for killing foot odor which is why it\u2019s marketed for feet. But\u2026 also here on Amazon, you can purchase silver infused socks that last much longer than a jar of ointment to cure foot issues.<br /><br />The silver properties are excellent for first aid as well and in my opinion make better use of the ointment (based on cost effectiveness for purpose). It\u2019s good for minor skin irritations, cuts, abrasions and especially burns.<br /><br />It came in handy initially as I managed to burn myself promptly after receiving it. It helped the burn heal much faster, while keeping infection at bay, than if I had just let nature take its course.<br /><br />I learned about the healing properties of colloidal silver about 20 years ago when my daughter burned herself as a little girl. The ER doctor sent us home with colloidal silver cream and it fixed her right up.<br /><br />I like to keep it on hand now for just such emergencies. Highly recommended. I'm very happy about its moisturizing effect. It's absorbed quickly so it doesn't make sheets or socks greasy. Nice subtle scent. Is very rich but easily absorbs into the skin without feeling too greasy. I use it just before bed and my feet feel soft and smooth the next morning.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! This jar of Colloidal Silver Foot Cream by Silver Miracles arrived with a double safety seal. A clear plastic seal outside and internally, under the lid, another seal.<br /><br />It is white and the cream is easy to use and once applied is easy to massage into the skin.<br /><br />I\u2019m not exactly sure why this is Foot Cream, as it has many uses on the body.<br /><br />My first exposure to this type of product occurred when I needed a remedy for poison ivy. While it is not intended for that, it can help with reducing the spread of poison ivy and did seem to help mine heal faster. I did rely mostly on drying lotions like Calamine, to stop the oozing.<br /><br />You are instructed to first wash the affected area, then dry it, before applying this cream. So, it\u2019s not really like a lot of other creams which you simply apply. I suppose you will still benefit from it if it is not washed, but the label was referencing feet, which can get really dirty. Wash hands after use.<br /><br />This is a great cream for small cuts, rashes, insect bites and burns.<br /><br />Recommended The foot cream is very moisturizing, rich and creamy.<br /><br />I read the ingredients before I ordered and was maybe expecting a nice almond scent, since almond oil was one of the first ingredients but no it smells a bit more like minty something.<br /><br />I do think the cream works very nice but the container is small and won\u2019t last a real long time.<br /><br />I ordered to use especially in the summer time when I am wearing sandals all the time and my feet get so dry .\n", "\nProduct ID: B08V131NBS\nTitle: boqq 2 PCS Organic Gray Reverse Shampoo Bar, Essence Hair Darkening Shampoo Soap, Shampoo Bar, Hair Darkening Shampoo Bar, Polygonum Multiflorum for Hair Repair, Hydrate Hair, Damaged Dry Treated\nAverage Rating: 3.1\nNumber of Ratings: 45\nFeatures: ['\u3010100% organic and natural\u3011: Pure natural plant ingredients, no harsh chemical detergents.

I like some oil in my scrubs for moisturizing, often I don\u2019t even need to apply lotion after using, but this one seemed extra oily and left the shower slippery. It separates, so needs to be shaken or stirred before using. It does leave my skin feeling smooth and provided you like coconut, the scent is nice. I like the scent of coconut but was a little worried that the scrub would feel greasy on the skin.  It was comfortable and left my skin feeling softer without feeling dry or oily.  The scrub has large salt granules and these are slow to dissolve, I like this better than a sugar scrub. This scrub smells so good, your body will be like a coconut snowcone after your use this. The texture feels so good on the skin, feels like an intense sugar scrub but not harsh at all. Really enjoyed using this and how my skin felt and smelled afterward. Review for: 100% PURE Coconut Body Scrub<br /><br />I love body scrubs and I love when they have an oil base that that helps to fight winter dryness. This one has a wonderful oil base that coats my skin and really hydrates it. It also smells fantastic. Because this is oil based, it does leave any oily film on my shower floor. I deal with this by turning my hot water all the way up and then rinsing the floor really well before getting out of the shower. This is a good body scrub that exfoliates plus moisturizes your skin.  It also smells great.  Although it contains oils, it doesn't leave your skin excessively oily once you rinse it off.  It just leaves your skin soft and smooth. This scrub works great it\u2019s very moisturizing.The granules are on the bigger side.It has a coconut scent that dries down to a very light hint of a fragrance after awhile.The hydrating effect last long. Definitely not my favorite. I feel that it\u2019s a bit pricey for the quality. A lot more rough than I\u2019m used to while also being a little too oily. Didn\u2019t like the residue it left behind in my shower floor. Smelt alright but like I said, not the best. This is a refreshing body scrub. I was pleasantly surprised with how nice it left my skin. I also enjoy the coconut scent. Overall I would recommend this product. Awesome scrub for legs makes skin feel silky smooth.\n", "\nProduct ID: B09MHXMH8X\nTitle: Ulta Beauty Box Glam Edition.

The scrunchies are made of a nice satin type fabric. The sunglasses don't actually offer much sun protection, but they are cute. I got the satin bridesmaid scrunchies in rose gold and I love the color. I got this for myself and my two daughters to match. For $6, you get 6 pieces of satin scrunchies. That\u2019s a steal of a deal! The scrunchies are nice and durable. I used it for high ponytails for my girls (7yrs & 9yrs old) and it looks elegant. I love it! A cute set of bridal and bridesmaids hair ties and sunglasses for a bridal party. There were 5 rose gold hair ties and sunglasses for your bridal party and one white hair tie and sunglass for the bride. The hair ties comes in a satin material, but some of the thread was coming off on one of the hair ties. The sunglasses comes in a nice beautiful heart shaped but is a little uncomfortable to wear for a long period of time. These scrunchies hold tight and do not slide off. The satin cover keep the elastic from grabbing your hair. Pretty pink color and a special white one for the bride. Cute set. These make nice bridesmaids gift. I love these, these are so cute and would be great for a photo-op. They are great items to put into gift bags for your bridesmaids.<br /><br />I think that these would be so great during the summer, and amazing if someone was having a beach wedding!<br />(Also, if you are having a girls weekend  Bachelorette party, these would also be a great gift for those girls of yours, you all can wear them and match!!!! And then you can have the scrunchies for your wedding!!!)<br /><br />I can see many opportunities for you and your girls to use these.<br /><br />A little touch like this, can be fun and I love the heart glasses because they are so cute, but I also love the touch of humor on the scrunchies. The bridal party would love the fact that it says, \"to have and to hold your hair back\". It makes me smile, every time I read that! It adds abit a humor to it.<br /><br />These scrunchies are extremely comfortable, my daughter usually hates scrunchies, they usually fall out of her hair easily but she seems to love these. As for the sunglasses, my daughter didn't care to much for it, she said it doesn't sit on her nose correctly but it seemed to look good on her. I actually love the sunglasses. It adds a special touch that we needed.<br /><br />I would recommend these for a wedding on the beach or in the summer, or if you expect it to be a bright sunny day!<br /><br />I would also recommend these as items to put into bridesmaids gift bags.<br /><br />The quality seems to be exactly what I had expected and I am quite pleased.<br /><br />I would like to note: You may not want go wear the sun glasses all day, but for a few hours here and there, it is quite cute and stylish.<br /><br />These sun glasses and hair bows would also help coordinate your bridal party, without braking the bank. Little touches like this, really does make a difference.<br /><br />(These are to be used for wedding next summer.) [[VIDEOID:60519bea0e911630c2af5aa31ddd34a9]] I DO RECOMMEND THIS SET TO EVERYONE! YOU HAVE TO SEE IT IN PERSON TO BELIEVE IT! GREAT FOR ALL TYPES OF GET TOGETHERS NOT JUST FOR WEDDING PARTIES! THE SCRUNCHIES ARE SO SATIN AND BEUTIFUL EVERYTHING IS PACKAGED SO VERY WELL. THE VALUE IS GREAT AND FAST SHIPPING FOR THIS ITEM!<br /><br />PLEAE SEE PICTURE BELOW These are super cute and perfect for bridesmaids. This came in a set of six. Definitely make a good gift for any occasion or keep them for yourself. Pretty color! Worth buying! Cute rose gold color on the scrunchies. They don\u2019t feel like the best quality but they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ll fall apart quickly. My head is small so I typically have a hard time finding sunglasses that fit me securely. I can tell these glasses are on the larger side compared to other sunglasses I have tried on in stores and these slip off my head easily. However, this is a me problem and not the product so if you have a smaller head I would say these fit larger than expected. At $20, each item is $1.67 so I think this product is fairly priced. Overall, I think this is a cute set to gift bridesmaids and good if you\u2019re not looking to spend a lot.\n", "\nProduct ID: B0BN14T4WQ\nTitle: ANOGOL Wig Cap+Santa Claus Wig with Mustache{1 Pair*Eyebrows + 1pc*Christmas Hat+1*Glasses } Christmas Long Wavy Cosplay Wig White Beard Wig Synthetic Hair for Christmas Costume Halloween Party Celebration\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nNumber of Ratings: 47\nFeatures: ['\u2665\u2665 \u3010Package inclued\u3011:5pcs set:1 wig cap+1 merry Christmasta wig with beard+1 pair of eyebrows + 1 Christmasta hat+1 glasses.

Bought it for a God costume for my husband for a silly party we went to. Hair was full and thick enough to serve its purpose. We\u2019ve done Santa for a few years now and this was the best looking of all!!! We borrowed a Santa costume from a friend for a work event and he had warned us that the wig and beard were more than a little rough looking, and he was right. After reading the reviews, this is the set we chose. The beard and the wig is what we used though it came with eyebrows, too, and both were fantastic. Our Santa had short hair, so we did not use a wig cap. The beard fit very well. Both items were easy to use, and of GREAT quality. We lightly brushed it with a detangling brush and the items brushed out easily. Think expensive doll hair, not cheap synthetic that sheds. Wonderful value!! Great hair. Good quality! Thought the eyebrows were missing but found that they fell out. Fullness of hair. Doesn't look like the picture at all. VERY cheaply made.

The bundle arrived and was packaged very well. I co-washed it and added it to my wig. I love this hair! It blends very well with my wig too-No difference in quality- 5 stars! I would buy it again. [[VIDEOID:1934f0f67cabc674049e4dcdfc2b6e0f]] Lace is very dark and thin hair quality is not there u get what you pay for Holds body wave very well. I do a two strand pigtail twist and out my satin bonnet on at night. DON'T PUT ANY PRODUCTS ON IT!! Has a natural sheen. I just put 3 drops of Aragon oil on my hands rubbed together and ONLY applying to my natural hair (leave out).<br />This hair is extremely soft. Easily manageable, low tangles, and little to no shedding. I only use my fingers or a super soft boar paddle brush as needed. Manipulating the curl by combining and brushing too much may cause frizz and dryness. This is my first time buying real human hair but I know the stats and I did my research beforehand. If you are a first time buyer like me you won\u2019t be disappointed with this company. I got my hair and was skeptical about it so I did the pull test and burn test. They both checked out and the hair has double wefts. I forgot to take a before picture but the hair looks just like the company demonstration. I washed the hair first with a co-wash cleanser and let it dry overnight. It doesn\u2019t tangle bad or shed much. It curls well naturally or with heat. The middle picture was natural curls using twist with curling cream and Carol\u2019s daughter mousse. The others were with a 1\u201d curling wand on 330 degrees and coconut oil and Tresseme heat tamer spray. Coconut oil works excellent for this hair by the way. I recently washed my hair with it still on my head with sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. It\u2019s hard to dry my hair underneath with a blow dryer but I still protect the weave like my own hair or better because it is very delicate. This hair is so soft and manageable I wish it were my own and I feel like this is how my hair should be. The hair is darker than I thought but I got used to it. It\u2019s like a dark dark brown. I glad I found real human hair for a low price and 16, 18 and 20\u201d was longer than I thought. I got a closure also because I am 10 weeks into needing a relaxer. The closure is ok but I wanted a more natural look but I still got the closure to look real. I\u2019m in absolute aw of this hair. This is a real honest review and trust me, you won\u2019t regret this purchase.<br />Update: I only lasted for 2 installments and the second one was pushing it. The bundle don\u2019t have much  hair ...... but my experience whit costumer service was the best in quality well is not 100% but is not bad either. So I may buy this hair again I've had it in for 3 weeks almost now. Love the hair. It did lose a bit of luster after washing. Didn't shed till the end of 2nd week.<br />I'd buy again.

I was hesitating about ordering this product because of the price and after reading multiple reviews about different colors of the same polish that didn\u2019t have application thick enough. There were no reviews on this color (authentic apricot) and I decided to give it a try. I must say that I\u2019m very pleasantly surprised. The picture I attached was taken on the 4th day after application and this is ONLY 1 COAT! Usually, all nail polishes start peeling the same day, because I do a lot cooking/cleaning but this one holds so well, I\u2019m just amazed. And I should say that with the clean ingredients list and such a strong application it\u2019s worth the price. I felt like I had to leave this review to support the seller. Thank you to the company for making such good products! Great polish- helps your nails heal. Needed this for covering mail with fungal infection. Actually helped mail improve!<br />Great stuff- beautiful color! Very nice Needed anti-fungal protection. This polish has a true color, nice shine, dries fast, durable and is a good thickness. Took two coats but that's not unreasonable. I prefer that instead of overly thick polish. Kid of spendy but will buy again.  Recommend! I am a nail color addict & feel happier with a bright on my nails. I am also health oriented & don't want to put toxic stuff on me. I was recovering from using the llght cure color gels. My nails were especially dry& peeling. I use all the  supporting products with this. For me it stays on as well or better than other color brands, goes on smoothly with a pretty good shine to finish & dries quicker than others I've tried. It wears well. No smell.<br /> I'm finally coming to terms with the idea that if a polish is  stronger than a healthy fingernail it will damage a fingernail, healthy or not. I write that because in my eternal quest for chip free polish, I forgot to respect that a healthy fingernail is not supposed to be some diamond strong plate to be misused as a screwdriver! I need to wear gloves for any activity that's tough enough to damage a good, healthy fingernail.<br />As to specific color: it's a cream, medium, slighty warm, pink that's bright enough for toes but still not &#34;fluorescent&#34; or &#34;beachy.&#34; I have fair olive skin tone & i I like it, dont know if it works yet This is a great product. My nails were thrashed, due to gel manicures. This saved them. Yes, its a little pricey, but its not just polish, its helps you regain and maintain the health of your nails Beautiful color TRUSTING TURQUOISE. The color deepens after it dries to a perfect Robins Egg color and sheen.<br /><br />This bottle has Smooth application. Love the extra large curved brush. My last bottle of this brand didn\u2019t have that and I never could get the color evenly applied on my big toes. Now that I see how well this color went on and dried, I think the other color I bought last year was old or defective because it would dry before I could finish the whole big toe and end up with streaks and smudges. This color Turquoise is beautiful for Spring. I love it!<br /><br />I also love that I don\u2019t worsen the nail fungus I have using this brand, it costs a lot but it\u2019s worth it. It may even be improving it. Good quality nail polish, doesn\u2019t chip, goes on easily, smooth. Has a wide brush easy to paint nails with this brush. Color is for everyday summer use. Visited my Podiatrist.  He told me to stop always having polish on my toenails.  Said my nails needed to breathe.  When I pushed back he told me then I had to only use Dr.'s Remedy polish.  I immediately bought both this polish and the base (to use as the base and top coat).  I was surprised how well it went on and lasted.  My new go-to brand for nail health.\n", "\nProduct ID: B0C5V83YMB\nTitle: YouClean 300 Antibacterial Travel Hand Soap Sheets - Pocket/Purse/Wallet/Backpack -Great for Outdoor Camping or Daily Use (Tea Party) (Tea Party)\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nNumber of Ratings: 35\nFeatures: ['PORTABLE TRAVEL SIZE -- Each YouClean collection has 3 tiny boxes (2 x 1 x 0.25 inches) (5 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm) which nicely fit in any purse/ wallet, handbag, pack-backs that come in handy everywhere and at any time.

This set should have included 8pks, consisting of 400 sheets total. However, I only received 4 packs which consisted of just 200 sheets total.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with the addition of water these sheets dissolve into hypoallergenic soap that actually lathers quite well. They\u2019re mildly scented, compact, handy and they work to ensure \u201cYOUCLEAN!\u201d [[VIDEOID:5fbfb533f795c905ded71643a547b213]] I got these for a long trip with the kids and they are great! Small enough to fit literally anywhere, and as long as you have water you have soap to wash your hands on you! The toilet on our plane ran out of soap and we used these. We used these on the train. We used them waiting for the train after being on local transport. Just really awesome!! Very nice 4 little pockets for the soap sheet.  Smell is mild, and it does generate decent bubbles when used.  Minus one star is because I only got 4 packs when the description says 8. Unfortunately, I only got half of them, so I wasn't able to accurately review these. I got the lemon, tea tree, peach, and jasmine ones. Since I got the set mainly for the rose and coconut ones, I was definitely disappointed.<br /><br />The four that I did receive do smell decent. The scent is pretty mild. In my opinion, of the ones that I got, the jasmine and the peach smell the best. They do provide some suds, but they definitely don't suds up as well as I had hoped. They are a good size for putting in your purse, backpack, or another bag, and they will work in a clean-up emergency. Even if I'd gotten all eight packages, I probably wouldn't get these again. Advertises 8 packs, you get 4....advertises 8 scents, you get 2 (3 packs all have the same scent). The product page states they are paraben-free, bleach-free, etc., however, no where on the page or any of the packages is there a list of ingredients. I'm still debating on whether or not I actually want to use them! However, as of right now, I do not recommend. These soap sheets are great for traveling. They are easily portable in their little travel cases and are convenient for on the go. The start dissolving immediately when you get them wet, but they did require a little rubbing to get them to dissolve completely, which is great since they help ensure a good job at washing your hands. Each color is a different scent, and most scents are nice. Of course, I like some better than others, but that's a matter of personal preference. One sheet was plenty for washing my hands. They are great for traveling and if you go somewhere that the soap ran out or just isn't available. I love that they help me stay clean while on the go. works just like soap! perfect for on the go, you can throw in your bag or purse I have been buying these little soap dispensers with soap sheets in them for a while now (cos of the pandemic) and this pack is probably the best value I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve paid $5 for one filled dispenser, with a generic scent one time, and i still thought that was a great thing to have. With this pack of 8 different scents, for less than $16, you\u2019re getting a package for less than $2.<br />To say they are handy is an understatement. They are a Godsend. I don\u2019t know how often I\u2019ve gone into a bathroom, and the soap dispenser is empty. I was recently camping, and their soap dispenser in the toilets was empty during our whole stay. One thoughtful camper, left a bar of soap in a clear plastic cup, but it was a bit grimy with hairs on it, and i didn\u2019t want to use that. With these handy pocket, or purse sized dispensers, you have a fresh sheet of soap each time. And they lather up very easily, as soon as they get wet.<br />They are small enough to put into the smallest purse, even your wallet, or pocket, and you\u2019ll never be caught it out the ability to wash your hands.<br />These will last a while, as I\u2019m not planning on giving any away. I might offer a sheet here and there, but not a whole dispenser for goodness sake. I\u2019ll tell them where they can get their own.<br />I\u2019m currently using the Tea Tree and it\u2019s very fresh. I do feel very clean after using these, and will continue to recommend them to my friends.<br />Great value pack. These tiny soaps are perfect for travel and I love them for camping.<br />Easy dissolve. Great packaging I really like these little soap sheets. I keep a pack in my purse and they have come in handy whenever there is no soap available. This is a must have during this Covid era and even more if you have kids. They find it to be so much fun and like washing their hands more when it's fun for them. The only thing is that the little envelope they come in is mislabeled and you only get 4 instead of 8. I did contact CS and they sent me another pack of 4 right away. So I hope this is fixed cause I am sure many people don't know that the can call and get their order corrected.\n", "\nProduct ID: B0C619KBLQ\nTitle: Duke Cannon Supply Co.

I've used Naval Supremacy and a couple of others (mint scented one and citrus scented one), all to my delight. Well, I tested the smell in Target through my face mask. I definitely smelled the sandalwood, and couldn't detect much Tobacco scent. SO I figured I'd give it a try, assuming the tobacco component would be that sweet smell (\"like raisins\") I remember from growing up in Winston-Salem NC. Much to my disappointment, the first time I showered with this, I felt like I was smearing my spouse's ashtray all over my body. I don't know if this will grow on me, or if I'm Just going to be completely disgusted every time I use this product. Only $6 at Target in the store , smells mostly like leather in a good way, been using a small amount daily in the shower as body wash or shampoo and it\u2019s Only half empty after 6 months, a little goes a long way. Has tiny amounts of grit in it for exfoliation.  I love this stuff. Nice and thick Very thick. A little goes a long way. Smells amazing. Scent lasts for hours without being overpowering Everything was totally awesome You want to smell like the starring man in a romance movie but also smell like a character from road house? Look no farther! Jk but seriously I bought a whole case of this stuff because it\u2019s that good, and I legitimately won\u2019t use another body wash, ever. I hope they never stop making this. As most my reviews on body wash, I always state; hard water takes more soap then moderate to soft water, to lather. In this case, I can use very little, like maybe a bit less than a table spoon on my loofah (yes I do use one) and can lather this Greek bod from toes to head no problem.<br /><br />The smell is there but for me, not very strong at all.  I like the scent and whish it was a bit stronger. This is not a deodorant soap, so it does not leave a scent on the skin after drying off. Though it does clean very well and rinses off with ease. There is no after slime or weird tacky feeling. The soap does have beads in it, so if you are a hands and soap person, you will like that.<br /><br />The scent is difficult to describe so I won't try..<br /><br />This stuff will last a long time as it takes very little, for medium water, not hard or soft water, just in the middle, to lather and clean. Love this body wash.  Has a great smell and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed. If you like a rustic, country, leather smell, with a bit of tobacco. This is it! It\u2019s cruelty-free. Decent size and price point. Has Aloe-Vera.<br /><br />It\u2019s not Woke like other mainstream companies out there. They donate to to Veterans. While respecting and honoring what a real Man is.\n"]}
