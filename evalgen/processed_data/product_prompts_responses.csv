Review Text: My daughter uses this soap for my grandson's acute excema!  It works wonders!  It clears his skin right up, and it smells good too!  LOVE THIS SOAP! Typical of Yardley, a nicely scented soap that I look forward to using.  I would buy it, or any Yardley soap again (love the lemon and lavender scents too,)  They make me feel refreshed. Great soap with light scent. Decent price. Smells wonderful, great as a skin moisturizer.  Shipped QUICKLY and the price was definitely right.  I will buy this again. I will never order this product again!! This soap makes my skin dry out!!! It smells great though, but smell is not everything. Great product I was disappointed to see them sold in my local dollar store. *sigh* I was disappointed to see them sold in my local dollar store. *sigh*

Review Text: Always love their products. Little pricey though. No allergens to bother my scalp.  Made my hair soft and full.  I highly recommend this conditioner for anyone with sensitive skin or skin allergies. This company ran by women has made a wonderfully thick and effective non toxic series - this conditioner Ive been using for 10 years since developing an issue with many products after being poisoned.  I simply love this product, my go to hair product.  Many comment on my full head of long grey hair, thick at 62, My wife bought this more for the ingredients than the hair loss factor.<br />She is struggling with hair loss, has not used this product long enough to be able to judge long term change.<br />She has bad allergies to.. Well everything!<br />Being a fragrance free allergen free product this has performed well. With no reactions. It adds quite a bit of volume and fullness. Her hair has not looked so full and thick in several years.<br />This is now her primary goto product at a cost much lower than product we have previously tried. This is a great everyday conditioner for anyone with fine hair. If you need fragrance-free hair products, this is a great brand to buy. I have used the regular shampoo for years, but my store is always out of it.  I looked online and saw there was a conditioner for thinning hair.  I liked this because it seemed thick and it did condition my hair better than other products.  I am pleased with it.  There aren’t many fragrance free conditioners available so it is great to find one that is so good. This conditioner is good in the fact that it doesn't have fragrances, parabens, etc. and is gentle for chemically sensitive, but it is very thin and watery for a conditioner. Desert Organics Fragrance Free is much thicker and better, but more expensive per oz. I guess I will be buying the more expensive one from now on.

Review Text: Worked fine. This is my first time using plain silk wrap and I love it!  I started using the self adhesive silk tabs to fix cracks and they worked great so I wrapped all my nails but I had to keep buying them. So I upgraded to this. I'm so glad I did. Yes it takes longer to do my nails now but it's so totally worth it. I wrap my nails every week or so and there's still so much of it left! I will not buy anything else, EVER! This product is great for mending broken and cracked nails, but it is a little difficult to cut the silk to the right size. Too thick for me. This silk wrap has been very hard for me to find so I was super excited when I saw it on amazon. It seems everyone has the pre-cut ""stickers"" but it's hard to find the silk strips like these. Product arrived nicely packaged and there is a lot of silk in there but on one of the strips it has been cut and sewed together on a diagonal which means you cannot use that whole area (about 3 inches long), at least not the way I apply my silk. This was disappointing, but the rest of the silk is usable. Used as directed, fell of in 24 hours.  I was hoping to find something to strengthen my nails, as I use them a lot for arts and crafts.  Fake nails damage my nails, so I was hoping this would be an alternative, but now I'll just be using it for...arts and crafts. Does what it says! My daughter uses this to repair broken nails. She loves it Works well. My daughter loves her nails and keeping them long. She also loves basketball and being active. See where this is going? She broke a nail and we used this plus gel polish to repair the nail until the length had grown out. It is strong, thin, easy to use, and sheer enough that it looked natural.

Review Text: This product is amazing!!!!! I have always used Ben NYE products for Halloween, and this brand continues to exceed my expectations. Highly recommended.<br />Tip: if you do not want the thick look, just add a teaspoon of water to a small bowl and poor the liquid in with the teaspoon of water. I used a a baby medicine syringe to drip the liquid onto my skin and my costume. Dries daily quick and doesn’t stay tacky. Looks super realistic! Used Halloween worked ok I bought this fake blood for a film where I needed to have the actress spitting blood out into a cup. It worked perfectly. The blood tastes minty but slightly like cough medicine and has a cough medicine after taste to it. It's thick like real blood and certainly looks like real blood. Make sure to brush your teeth after or rinse your mouth out because the red gets all over your teeth. But it's probably the best fake blood on the market. I would definitely buy this again This stage blood works so amazing with skin and latex so no matter the look  you’re going for it’ll work great!!! Highly recommend for special FX makeup or even to prank someone (but don’t say I told you to do it lol). Buy with confidence! I’ve tried many types of stage blood but was never as satisfied as I was with Ben Nye, so I recently decided to go back. Honestly it’s the best out there: Rich, realistic color and pooling; and sticks to skin, liquid latex, and any makeup. Dries quickly but still gives flexibility for dripping or other movement. good quality good taste It came quickly, is a great product, however the cap was split in half then packaged. I can't carry this easily. I love ben nye! Used this for a boudoir shoot. It turned out very good. Blood is realistic and tastes like mint. It didn’t stain either! I couldn’t believe that part.

Review Text: It might just be my hair, but this makes my hair feel greasy anytime I use it.  It has a nice smell, but it just doesn't work for me. I was relieved to find this product available on Amazon.com.  The quality of the Color-Shield can not be beat by another manufacturer.  Until recently, it was readily available in all stores.  The conditioner is truly lightweight, and leaves the hair with lots of body.  Smells great.  Helps maintain color for weeks. Got this because I dyed my hair blue and needed some sort of sealant to keep from staining everything. Since I started using it the staining has lessened considerably, so I'm pleased. It also has a very light grape scent, which I like. I use about a dime/quarter sized amount and thoroughly massage it though my hair, focusing on the ends. Helps to smooth the hair, and I like that it helps protect hair from UV damage. Very light-weight product and doesn't make my hair feel greasy (I just make sure to not use more than a quarter-sized amount!).

Review Text: Can't comment on its specialist abilities or anything but hmmm... I smell amazing.<br />I rubbed the oil sparingly all over my body and all day I have this vanilla faint spice on me. It is amazing.<br />Plus it says oil but it is not REALLY oily, nice and thin, almost with the consistency of water. Fast shipping ,smell a little strong but it is okay I like it. Just started using my first bottle and is doing well so far. Subtle scent, with a lovely glow on the skin. I think it is not good for my skin I recently moved to the desert in California and my skin was forever dry. I tried so many different types of lotions to just end up dry and ashy at the end of the day. This oil smells delicious, it has lavender and rosemary and coconut oil. It glides on smoothly and evenly. It is a bit pricey at $8.00 but I pay that for coconut oil anyway. I would not recommend it for your face because it may clog pores because it does have mineral oil that is why I gave it four stars instead of five. It is great for the rest of your body especially your feet. Put some on your feet at night throw on some white tube socks and viola soft feet in the morning. It is great for massage as well. A friend recommended this product and I'm just hoping it's the same content inside because it's not well sealed, some of the oil already leaked inside the package by the time I opened it...so I'm hoping I got the right one for the cold season coming up.

I like practicing doing my own nails so I don't have to run out. I received the package 14 days from the day i ordered, so it technically arrived early.. Without considering how crazy inexpensive the tips cost they worked very well, they are more on the &#34;ligh tduty&#34; side.

Worth the price. Since I am just learning the basics of doing nails this makes it easy for me to have fabulous nails! Thank you for making a great and affordable product! When you buy nails they come sizes 0-10. These don't. After such a long wait I was disappointed. Also it's easier to just shape square nails because once to clip them the point is no longer there. Will not be ordering again. Product arrived on time and I am satisfied with the way it was packaged. Perfect for doing my nails in the stiletto shape since it saves me some time in shaping the square tips. I love this. I've wanted stiletto nails for the longest. I found them here for cheap. Only thing I recommend you to so is cut them down a bit. As far as tips go they are exactly that. But most of mine weren't actually stiletto but had the points cracked off. All in all a nice product.  My wife told me however that once she cuts it, the strength of the nail weakens and it breaks more easily.  But once you keep it long it's a good buy.  For the price, it's not too bad. All in all a nice product.  My wife told me however that once she cuts it, the strength of the nail weakens and it breaks more easily.

Review Text: Nice rice I happened upon this at a big lots. I bought one bag, tried it and went back and cleaned them out. I have never seen it there again but lucky me I could buy it here.  This is the best white basmati rice I have eaten.  I cook it in a rice cooker two cups rice to 3 cups water.. It comes out nice and fluffy , fully cooked and not sticky in the least. Very long grains, just grab all the sauces you can think to pour over it. Fabulous with curry. Good taste Buy it!!I am a rice eater,This is my favorite rice . good price $18 for this rice This is one the worst rice for Persian style polo. I tried 5 times with different water proportions in rice cooker and boil and strain methods to no avail. It turned out sticky to the point it's unpresentable. Grains only look good uncooked. Get Royal chef's secret extra long grain instead. The best Basmati Rice..... I have tried all of them. Soak them for 30 min and then cook. Every single grain remains separate and what an aroma😃 Absolutely first-rate quality. Good quality stuff. Super service and product. Terrific quality and taste.  Soak first for best results.  Ten pounds sounds like a lot, but it will go fast!

Review Text: good product. I decided to try this because I don't want to use animal hair. It's a good brush but my only complaint is the handle! It's not solid and it pops open very easily. Water gets inside it every time I shave and I have to open it so it dries out. It's just not well designed. I will probably glue it and seal it to avoid this problem.<br />Putting that aside, the brush itself works well. It's easy to clean, dries quickly, and builds a nice lather. I would probably pick something with a solid handle instead of this. Good quality and works well. Excellent bang for your buck. Bristles are actually pretty soft contrary to what some naysayers are reporting. I was able to whip up a nice, foamy lather with this brush. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and I was able to comfortably use this brush on my face for all three passes. I'd argue that the softness of this brush is on par with entry-level silver tip badger brushes, and it isn't as stiff. The biggest pro is that this brush has no animal smell and doesn't require you to soak it in water. Personally, I prefer a nice soft brush instead of a stiff or rough brush. The only minor con was that there was a chip on the actual finish and the brush is travel size, but I didn't mind it that much. The small size means that it is portable and only takes up little space on my counter. Overall, you're getting a good amount of value for the money here. I highly recommend this brush for budget-conscious buyers as well as folks that are looking for an excellent starter brush. I would say this is a quality product especially for the price. It would not be my choice for a one and only brush because the knot is kind of small and the bristles don't ever splay out like a animal hair or more expensive synthetic brush. The tips of the bristles are nice and soft but the sides are not. Each bristle is shaped like a very tiny curly cue which adds a lot of scrubbing power to it. This is great for loading up soaps and building a lather very quickly but can be a little harsh on the skin if that is a concern for you. If your skin isn't especially sensitive I wouldn't worry about that, in fact I kind of like it for the extra exfoliation. I would recommend this as a travel brush for it's quick drying and if it gets lost or damaged you're not out much money. I bought this synthetic brush for travel because I had read that synthetic brushes dry very quickly.  This is certainly the case, as the brush does air dry within a few minutes.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the very good performance of this shaving brush: it has good backbone for lathering, but the bristles are not scratchy. The loft on this brush is a little tall.  I've found with synthetic brushes the water all comes out to the outside of the brush and they just leak like a sive.  Otherwise the brush works okay.. Bought it for a cheap travel brush, and I'm sure it will be fine for that. Wouldn't buy it for day to day use. I wanted a synthetic for travel, and thought the price was great. This brush exceeded my expectations for two solid weeks straight.

Review Text: Love this product. It has such a nice fresh taste and makes a great difference to inflamed or bleeding gums. Will definitely order more! I've gone through only 1 tube so far.  When I started using it I was seeing my dentist with some very serious pain and bad conditions with my gums. I hadn't eaten in 2 months due to my teeth feeling loose and my gums were getting multiple abscess that were painful.  It has only been a week and returned to my dentist today and she was AMAZED AT THE CONDITION OF MY GUMS.  She measured my gums today and they showed 50% improvement in one week.  I can see where my gums have grown and my teeth are incredibly stable.  I also used the gum powder with this product because I am excessive in my treatments, but these two products worked.  The insert Gum Tone said that with constant use, your gums will reach a healthy status that your dentist will notice... and today it lived up to  what it said.  This stuff is amazing.  An ancient formula that works miracles.

Review Text: I am totally disappointed with this headband. One it is super cheap and easily bendable which means it will break easily. I have very fine hair so this headband is just horrible with my hair. It sticks up at the top and doesn't hold any hair back because my hair just slides out of it. Now, if someone has very thick hair then this would work perfect for them but for someone like me with very fine hair, this headband just isn't right for me.

Description: ['he TVLink II basestation is independent of the Phonak hearing instrument model. It sends the audio stream via a Phonak streamer.

Review Text: The original TVlink I did not have a optical input, so they added a crippled one to the Tvlink II.  The issue is that virtually all modern TV sets output audio thru a optical connector and are set to Dolby Digital 5.1 by default.  The Tvlink II will not respond to a optical signal with Dolby Digital.  Why??  The Resound Reunite works fine with a Dolby Digital optical signal.<br /><br />So, if your TV allows it, you can go into setup and muck around to change the audio decoding to PCM in order to make the TV link II work.  Unfortunately, many Panasonic and LG TV sets will not allow you to change to force PCM output, so you need to buy a separate decoder.  A high quality decoder is expensive, the cheap ones delay the signal.<br /><br />So, my Tvlink II works with my Samsung TV once I changed the audio format, but not my Panasonic. I got a TV LinK II and streamer when I bought new hearing aids in 2016, but couldn't get it to work with my new Samsung  HD TV, after following all the steps in the user guide book.  Took the Link to the TV store, connected it to one of their TVs, worked fine.  Came home, reconnected, still didn't work.  Persuaded the TV salesman to stop by to fix the problem.  After several attempts, turns out the key was in setting the TV's Audio Format - not to Digital Dobey, but to PCM - which is a kind of universal program.  Bingo!  Optical cable from Samsung OneConnect Digital Output to TV Link Digital Audio Input on back of the base station, and clear, beautiful sounds flowed right in my ears.  This key tip was not in the TV Link User Guide.  The TV Link has improved my viewing and listening immensely.  Would never want to be without it again.  Five stars for the link, 3 or 4 stars for the user guide. Love this no more ear phones for me. Pick the voices from the tv with no problem at all I am only receiving intermittent sound from my unit and the comII has been checked and works fine. Can you help??? You need to know that this unit REQUIRES a Compilot to work, otherwise you have a useless piece of equipment. The webpage only says that it ""can be used"" with all Phonak streamers.  They will NOT take returns and the unit takes some time to get to you because it is being shipped from India. They make it sound like it is based in the US (Hearing Aid Zone). I did not know that it needed the Compilot to work and, now they say I cannot return it. I searched the webpage and did NOT find anything about NO RETURNS. I did do a lot of research beforehand because hearing aids are new to me but did not find anything anywhere that said you needed to spend almost $500 so you could hear the TV.<br />Since, I have found that my hearing aids will connect to a bluetooth TV. I think I can find a smart TV for $500 or less. Works perfect.  I needed an extra base for a second TV. An excellent product that more than met my expectations. The weakest link is the device that makes the connection between it and my  hearing aids . It works well, but  battery has a short charge lifespan and has to be recharged at least once if not twice a day. Returned one because it would not pair. Got a new one and it worked great. Discovered that you must be about a meter away for it to pair so the first failure was my fault. Have only used on tv. great base for my wife's hearing system This is an excellent product.  Thanks.

Review Text: This product does not perform as promised.  As many others have commented, it is a temporary effect, the same as you can get with glue.<br /><br />I also got snookered into getting this at a mall kiosk as a few others here have noted in their reviews. Always steer clear of any products where they have a &#34;No Refund&#34; policy. If it's a good product, they will absolutely give you a refund for an UNOPENED and unused product, which is what my case was.<br /><br />But of course, since this is a scam, they would not provide a refund. Listen up, especially my fellow dudes that want to roll back the clock a bit. This is an expensive parlor trick to hide wrinkles as well as bags under your eyes. The substance temporarily tightens your skin with a film that is lightly colored with a Caucasian base make up (at least mine is; maybe they have other shades -- I am in fact a Caucasian male). If you touch it after it dries it will break the seal and you will lose the effect. It only lasts until you wash again or rub the area. I doubt you'd get a full day out of an application.<br /><br />I feel foolish for getting suckered into this expensive product as I was told it would be possible to drop back to weekly for 4 months then put the rest in a freezer for a few years - LOL!<br /><br />If I were a woman that wore a good *spray-based* makeup product over top of it I might think it is worth the money. As a man that doesn't wear make-up, even though the skin tone is close to my own, I think you can easily see I am wearing some sort of cosmetic product.<br /><br />I will probably only use this for web meetings and special occasions and then not buy again. Just OK I'm pretty irritated with myself for falling for this, to be honest. Like most other reviewers, I got suckered into buying this garbage from a pushy sales person at a mall kiosk.  Even as I was recognizing her sales tactics, even with all the red flags, I still bought it. I guess it was just an expensive reminder: don't look a mall kiosk sales person in the eye.

Even as I was recognizing her sales tactics, even with all the red flags, I still bought it. I guess it was just an expensive reminder: don\'t look a mall kiosk sales person in the eye.\n'}]","# Vine Vera Resveratrol Shiraz Intensic Non-Surgical Syringe

I sent out a dozen of these for orders and received charge-backs for half of them due to the plastic roller ball malfunction.  It is a roller ball that does not roll!

The plastic rollerball that comes with these bottles does not roll.  The ball can't even be loosened up by moving it back and forth for a while.  The roller does not allow the oils to come through, the ball doesn't move - total waste of money. I’ve been using roll ons. For a very long time, but these have to be by far one of the worst ones I’ve ever used. The ball does not move at all. Tried popping it out, it won’t come out.

It took nearly 2 months to arrive and when it did arrive it it leaked all over and there was about a half of it left in the bottle. When I put it on it was mostly alcohol very little cologne and once I put on it would last about three hours.  I would recommend going to a certain department store where they have The real stuff and a body spray that cost about $60 and last all day and it's the real stuff it's not the cologne but it's the body spray and it's great.  And if you ask they will give you a small sampler bottle of the real stuff cologne for free. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUFF!  If I  were able to give it zero stars I would have Scent is fantastic - but I wish it stayed on longer Doesn’t smell like  Tom Ford tobacco vanillie!! This stuff is great! Accidentally ordered two bottles and not upset at all! The real stuff is oil based I don't think this is but regardless still smell almost identical and for $50 as opposed to $300 totally worth it!! Great deal.  Quality product for a very reasonable price.

Review Text: Ordered for my Halloween costume, they fit pretty good and I have chubby fingers lol I was shocked when these arrived that they are metal! My daughter put these on her Christmas wish list, so I bought them for her. They look really cool, and they're sturdy! She loves them, and they'll last a long time! Not the best quality rings but they look cook. they also slip off the fingers easily They fall off my fingers all the time, but they are so pretty! Got these for my daughter, they were on her list for Christmas. Showed up right on time, and exactly as pictured. She hasn’t used them yet, but I know she will love them These do what I wanted them to do, and ultimately I'm ordering another set, but the reason I'm doing that is...the sizes are INSANE.  They range from &#34;large&#34; to &#34;tiny&#34; and the tiny ones are PAINFUL.  They're really rigid metal (which is good, because that means they're durable), but they don't fit like they do in the picture.  I have US average woman's sized hands, and couldn't get my thumb in one and couldn't get my pinky in another, but the ones for my other fingers were too large? O_o? Really sturdy! Wore to a convention all weekend and none of the little gems fell off. Would buy again. Beautiful with my Raven Queen costume. I'm not sure where the seller got their measurements, because my fingers supposedly match their measurements and these were huge! I had to add so much hot glue inside them to get them to fit and I still spent the day worried they would fall off. They look cool, but they do not fit. These are ridiculously sized. Thumb fits... all others are way too big for my teenage daughter. She loved the look so I ordered 2 packs of ring sizers and went to work.

Review Text: My friend likes it This product is low quality not worth anything Great eye shadow. I really like the simplicity of it yet the shimmers gives a nice touch to my make up. Although, when I received it, it was mushed and scattered up. Much darker color than shown on picture but nice quality eyeshadow. It did not look like what it showed online. It was very light when it came. It look like it was supposed to be darker and that’s what I was expecting I was really disappointed especially since I ordered two. My product arrived broken. I didn't have time to return or find something else since I needed this for a military ball in 2 days. So as seen in the 1st picture I pressed it back together as well as I could.. it was completely crumbled when I opened it but I didn't take a picture since I didn't hesitate for a second to try to fix it.<br />I am upset that I didn't get the product in the way it was promised and for what I paid for. They need to fix however they are handling these shadows and take extra precaution since I know I wasn't the only one received a broken one..<br />Now, as seen in the next 3 images, this is what the shadow looks like on by itself (applied 2 light layers with finger). It's formula is really soft and easy to apply. It looks pretty for a simple everyday look.<br />The last 3 images are what I was able to do in a glam look (less than 5 minutes, ignore my lash not sticking) so, the pigmentation is not as strong as the advertisement makes it seem but it's still a very nice shimmer. There is a different shadow in my inner corner but the rest of the lid is the DGAF on top of regular eyeshadow.<br />I decided to give it 3 stars because of the good formula, the fact it pressed back together so it's still usable, and because you can still get a good look from it, it's a gorgeous color.<br />I would've rated this 5 stars if it wasn't because the product was broken. Shame.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

I really like the simplicity of it yet the shimmers gives a nice touch to my make up. Although, when I received it, it was mushed and scattered up. Much darker color than shown on picture but nice quality eyeshadow. It did not look like what it showed online. It was very light when it came. It look like it was supposed to be darker and that’s what I was expecting I was really disappointed especially since I ordered two. My product arrived broken. I didn\'t have time to return or find something else since I needed this for a military ball in 2 days. So as seen in the 1st picture I pressed it back together as well as I could.. it was completely crumbled when I opened it but I didn\'t take a picture since I didn\'t hesitate for a second to try to fix it.<br />I am upset that I didn\'t get the product in the way it was promised and for what I paid for. They need to fix however they are handling these shadows and take extra precaution since I know I wasn\'t the only one received a broken one..<br />Now, as seen in the next 3 images, this is what the shadow looks like on by itself (applied 2 light layers with finger). It\'s formula is really soft and easy to apply. It looks pretty for a simple everyday look.<br />The last 3 images are what I was able to do in a glam look (less than 5 minutes, ignore my lash not sticking) so, the pigmentation is not as strong as the advertisement makes it seem but it\'s still a very nice shimmer. There is a different shadow in my inner corner but the rest of the lid is the DGAF on top of regular eyeshadow.<br />I decided to give it 3 stars because of the good formula, the fact it pressed back together so it\'s still usable, and because you can still get a good look from it, it\'s a gorgeous color.<br />I would\'ve rated this 5 stars if it wasn\'t because the product was broken. Shame.<br /><br />Hope this helps.\n'}]","## Colourpop Super Shock Metallic Eyeshadow (DGAF)

Review Text: It's okay. This is my first time using super hard wax so my comment may lack some credibility, but I wasn't too impressed. Once you style your hair and the wax hardens, there's no more room for improvement. And once hair hardens, I feel like the thinness of the hair is more exposed. And I get scared when I try to brush through my hair because it feels like hair can fall off if I brush hard. I bought it style my longer look but now I'm thinking of cutting my hair short and then using the wax. Again, I never used super hard wax before so my view may be skewed. I've been trying to find the perfect one that can hold my hair, not make it too hard and look natural. This easily holds my hair up in any style. Korean cosmetics/accessories are the best, they really know their stuff. Between this and the pink Gatsby, this one holds better. second time to purchase this wax. i have been use many different brand of wax. this is the only one i use now. very strong hold, and very easy wash it off. My husband is only used it for years.<br /> It doesn't have a strong scent. It's nice. My hair is pretty hard, but it holds  And it’s not shiny.  I really like it.  Bought 3 of them. Great product and seller deliver on time and as presented.  Would definitely buy again My hair always pushed to the front and falls flat, this is strong enough to keep it in place. Be aware it’s 200ml in size so TSA may confiscate if they feel like it. I always use it for my hair. Actually my hair is very thick, hard and curled.<br /><br />This is my favorite wax ever.

Review Text: Raves from my daughter, a professional hair stylist and her co-workers Perfect good pricing for a product that does a great job for hair cutting. I learned some things when I was looking for hair cutting shears. Mostly that you can pay around $200 for the best ones,used by professionals,and,that you need very sharp scissors or shears to cut or trim hair.<br /><br />I've been trimming and shaping my own hair for a long time and am usually happy with the results,considering too many times,when I would go to a salon to have it cut or shaped or trimmed,they did a job I was almost always disappointed with. I decided a long time ago,if someone was going to screw up my hair,it might as well be me. At least I have a good idea on when to stop cutting it and I actually care what the final result looks like.<br /><br />I also have fine,wavy hair. Not the easiest to cut.<br /><br />I have noticed,and maybe it was from using whatever scissors were around at the time,that sometimes the ends do look a bit frazzled;and in researching shears,I found out that unless the blades are very sharp,the ends can break,or result in split ends. I don't have split ends and never noticed them,except for a long,long time ago when I was a teenager;but,I have used these once to do some light trimming and shaping;with wavy hair you are always shaping,cutting with the wave and not cutting against the wave. And,these shears have produced a nice result. And I don't see the somewhat frazzled or lightningbolt effect at the ends of my hair,that I sometimes get.<br /><br />I've used these just once,I only trim my hair to maintain healthy looking ends,and I did it a few weeks ago,and I like these and I'm glad I looked for something better than &quot;any old scissors&quot; that I have on hand. I am not a professional beautician, but because I cut my own hair I like to use professional tools. After watching a YouTube video, the professional recommended purchasing his Invisiblade shears, but they were much too expensive for me. I went on Amazon to see if I could find a similar pair at a better price and I did. I read the reviews for Mosher Salon Tools Thinning Shear & took a chance on my purchase. I am very glad I did because these shears have a nice weight & they are SHARP. I've used them once so far, but I'll be using them for each of my haircuts in the future. [[VIDEOID:fe56c1c7b2c296937aad5f5e7284457c]] ***As a licensed cosmetologist, I am writing this review from a personal AND professional standpoint****<br /><br />I really like these shears, and think they will work amazingly for a student, or anyone who needs a backup pair. I think its unique and awesome that the company who makes these have specialized in sharpening services for a long time. It definitely shows! They are well made, they are well weighted and the little jewel is a cute accent to the shears. I took the time to make a video to really break down all the pros and cons of these shears, so please take a moment to watch if you'd like an extensive review!<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or free, in exchange for an honest review.

Review Text: This was the first highlighter I've ever bought. At first I had nothing to compare it to so I gave it 4 stars. After using about 6 weeks I bought a new brand. Compared to that one, this is not very pigmented at all. Is difficult to spread and apply like it's dry but once on is actually really greasy. Has very short lived staying power. These are ok for the price I guess. But id rather spend the extra money and avoid the issues with these.

Review Text: Good product, liked it because it is rechargeable, however, it does not have as high RPM as a battery operated one. I've been using the battery operated one for many many years I got tired of the batteries not lasting long or operating as long as they should...Huge improvement would highly recommend A must for anyone who wants smooth skin and perfect toenails. My sister just got one of these Emjoi Micro-Pedis from Amazon, and told me about it. Love it!<br /><br />I have included a photo of my actual feet's results. Note that my &#34;before&#34; is NOT me neglecting my feet. On the contrary, it was taken just days after I spent half an hour on my tiring old razor, Ped-Egg, rasp, pumice stone routine. (And sometimes I would rasp off too much, then it would hurt to walk a few days. Ouch!)<br /><br />This product seems designed to prevent removing too much skin. If you push too hard the machine will basically stop. So, I find it best to let the machine do the work for me, just let it spin and spin, and I only apply gentle pressure…just enough pressure that the spinning slows slightly. It's so easy to use that I can do it almost without looking while watching TV.<br /><br /> I like the extension handle, particularly because it catches the powdered skin that comes out the holes on the device's underside. I just empty it into a small garbage can periodically as I go. The handle also makes it nice to reach around the far side of my foot since I am definitely not a contortionist. Make sure you firmly snap the device under the ridge that holds it into the extension handle: then it holds it nice and snug.<br /><br />Overall, a nice little device. Reasonable price, too. I had seen this demonstrated several years ago, so when I had need for one, I tried it. It takes your old tired rough feet and makes them smooth as a baby's butt. Worth every penny.

Review Text: Easy to make buns, for thick OR thin hair Perfect for first responder moms and the littles are perfect for little ballerinas! Mom loves it These are perfect for doing ballerina dance buns for my toddler! did not work for me. Worked really well for ballet recitals. They take a bit of practice but make a nice bun. Works just like they are supposed to. Works well This is a great product for securing and adding volume to an updo. These spongy donuts can be twisted, wound and pinned any way you please. I don't care for ""donut buns"", but I do take these little donut sponges and wind them up into a perfect, immovable, retro bouffant.  My favorite thing about these little donuts is that they are easily penetrated with bobby pins for the sturdiest, easiest updo ever. So much better than the bumpits, pads, scarves  and assorted inserts I wrestled with before finding these. I also like that you get more than one becuase this allows for experimentation- I took one of the donuts and cut it so that it is now one long spongy tube that I use to make the bouffant and beautifully giant French Twist (think Cate Blanchett in The House With a Clock in its Walls). So if you  want your hairdo large and sturdy this is a great choice. Five stars. Fast and easy hair do for my seven year old daughter in the mornings. She loves trying new things with her hair and there are tons of ways to use these magic hair donuts!

Review Text: great This is not actually like the big bulky Waterpiks that I remember.  It's just the right size and it's a dual combo...it also comes with the portable Waterpik that you can take with you when you travel (dual voltage).  UPDATE:  I loved this flosser so much that I recommended it to my brother and discovered that the other models have an on/off button on the device handle.  This feature would be a nice to have as this model you have to depress the button and hold it to keep the water from spraying out when you are moving it back to the base holder and transitioning to turn the unit on or off. Works good.  Small unit.  Sometimes need to add water to finish flossing. The best oral item you will ever buy. Pretty powerful and the portable one is convenient for travel... Can really tell the difference between this and flossing... Great products for both home use and travel. Highly recommend! I'm so glad I purchased this! I definitely feel the difference with my teeth. I have braces so this helps with keeping my gums healthy. Good product I got this as a gift to replace my old Waterpik flosser.

Review Text: This blade is truly amazing.  It follows my face very well and the blades really clean the whisker off very close to the skin.  I have not had any nicks and the blade is lasting for many many shaves.  I'm on my first blade and it is now just starting to loose its edge.  I recommend this blade and will buy them again. I get more than one shave with these blades. Tho, shaving three or four days growth shortens the life of the blades. My facial hair is tough but these blades give me a close shave. Good Best Buy that I could find! Great product! Like Like great very happy

Review Text: I really like the Almay line of cosmetics. Great for those with sensitive skin! I have very oily skin, so I do need to apply this every few hours in certain spots.  Other than that, it works well as a light powder to cover the shine on my face. Good-quality powder that never cakes or gets streaky.  It has staying power as well.  It's a must-have beauty staple. i work at a movie theater which means i'm behind the concession stand a lot, more than i like to be, so doing my makeup is a must. but also i need to take care of skin since i have sensitive skin. i haven't broken out since using this product (in conjunction with the liquid one i might add) and my skin just looks so much better. love it. This product is great. I cover all over and it doesn’t leave my face a different shade then the rest of me. It blends into my skin, but doesn’t cause breakouts. Love it! This is a great powder and it helps to keep my skin clear. It applies evenly and blends well. I don't like how the new design opens up on each side.  Now, it has a separate section on the bottom for the pad, but the lids are so hard to open - AND it makes you open each side in order to use it.  So I just leave the pad with the powder, like the old way. excellent buy, very satisfied, thank you The best Pressed Powder ever! My favorite!

Review Text: I've tried a lot of matte lipsticks and this one is the BEST.  The Latte Confession color is a bit darker and redder (I was hoping for a clay / pink) but it is an amazing product.  Stay power is wonderful even with drinking and eating.  I only need to reapply once after the initial application.  Pigmentation is strong also.  You truly get a great product for the value.  I purchased rose garden (the color is a bit brighter and neon pinker than I wanted) and just ordered innocent vixen too.  This is HUGE because I can never buy more than one of a lipstick because I don't truly love it.  Just a small note: it is a matte lipstick so it does dry my lips out a little.  I moisturize at night and I'm good to go.  It's also very easy to take off at the end of the day (no scrubbing or rubbing). I like it, but even if you apply a small amount your teeth will be brown la Splash lipsticks are great. Found out about them on YouTube Like the company, I personally did not like the shade.  Too bright pink for a middle-aged​ lady. I love the formula of these. They are comfortable and long-wearing, which is a rarity in liquid mattes. The smell is pretty horrid (like paint) but goes away once it dries. This particular color (latte) is a very grey-toned, pale nude which is unfortunately unflattering on me in natural light. I am very fair-skinned with pink undertones and my boyfriend legitimately thought I was having breathing problems because my lips looked blue. Even though this shade didn't work for me I would absolutely try others in this line. This lipstick in Retro Bettie is a MUST HAVE for my beauty regimen as a jazz singer. I have to put my face on about an hour before I get to a gig, which is an hour before it starts, and it lasts 3 hours: so I need a lipstick that can last a minimum of 5 hours. THIS IS THAT LIPSTICK!<br /><br />It goes on smooth, and the tip is like a typical lip gloss applicator. But it is not forgiving (it will temporarily stain your regular skin if you're not careful!), it is forever. Once you put it on just hang out with your mouth open for 30 seconds for it to seal in, and then you're good to go, with drinks and everything, for at least my usual 5-hour stint.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this lipstick does smudge off, or even wash off: it flakes off. Which is kind of amazing since I don't use makeup remover: I just rub my lips against each other, or rub them with a paper towel or washclothes and the whole thing comes off easily.<br /><br />NOTE: Your lips will feel dry by the end of the night because they will be, but you CANNOT add a lip gloss or chapstick atop this lipstick or it will completely lose its efficacy as a stay-put product: it will move around and stain everything—I learned this the hard way.<br /><br />Almost every pic on my Instagram (@ojanmarie) has me wearing this excellent shade, which is a true red, on the slightly blue-red side, but not bright like a tomato, much deeper and more saturated than that. It will go on your lips a lighter shade and will dry darker, just FYI.<br /><br />Good luck using my fav product!!! I love it, although it does smear if it gets wet. This is a great product, works as advertised, and the color is wonderful. It stays on really well. I am very happy about that. It is a little dull though and makes your lips look a little dry. Other than that it was pretty good I love LA Splash lipsticks.  They last and you only need one swipe of the wand to get full coverage color.  They can feel very dry on the lips, but I don't mind that.

The Latte Confession color is a bit darker and redder (I was hoping for a clay / pink) but it is an amazing product.  Stay power is wonderful even with drinking and eating.  I only need to reapply once after the initial application.  Pigmentation is strong also.  You truly get a great product for the value.  I purchased rose garden (the color is a bit brighter and neon pinker than I wanted) and just ordered innocent vixen too.  This is HUGE because I can never buy more than one of a lipstick because I don\'t truly love it.  Just a small note: it is a matte lipstick so it does dry my lips out a little.  I moisturize at night and I\'m good to go.  It\'s also very easy to take off at the end of the day (no scrubbing or rubbing). I like it, but even if you apply a small amount your teeth will be brown la Splash lipsticks are great. Found out about them on YouTube Like the company, I personally did not like the shade.  Too bright pink for a middle-aged\u200b lady. I love the formula of these. They are comfortable and long-wearing, which is a rarity in liquid mattes. The smell is pretty horrid (like paint) but goes away once it dries. This particular color (latte) is a very grey-toned, pale nude which is unfortunately unflattering on me in natural light. I am very fair-skinned with pink undertones and my boyfriend legitimately thought I was having breathing problems because my lips looked blue. Even though this shade didn\'t work for me I would absolutely try others in this line. This lipstick in Retro Bettie is a MUST HAVE for my beauty regimen as a jazz singer. I have to put my face on about an hour before I get to a gig, which is an hour before it starts, and it lasts 3 hours: so I need a lipstick that can last a minimum of 5 hours. THIS IS THAT LIPSTICK!<br /><br />It goes on smooth, and the tip is like a typical lip gloss applicator. But it is not forgiving (it will temporarily stain your regular skin if you\'re not careful!), it is forever. Once you put it on just hang out with your mouth open for 30 seconds for it to seal in, and then you\'re good to go, with drinks and everything, for at least my usual 5-hour stint.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this lipstick does smudge off, or even wash off: it flakes off. Which is kind of amazing since I don\'t use makeup remover: I just rub my lips against each other, or rub them with a paper towel or washclothes and the whole thing comes off easily.<br /><br />NOTE: Your lips will feel dry by the end of the night because they will be, but you CANNOT add a lip gloss or chapstick atop this lipstick or it will completely lose its efficacy as a stay-put product: it will move around and stain everything—I learned this the hard way.<br /><br />Almost every pic on my Instagram (@ojanmarie) has me wearing this excellent shade, which is a true red, on the slightly blue-red side, but not bright like a tomato, much deeper and more saturated than that. It will go on your lips a lighter shade and will dry darker, just FYI.<br /><br />Good luck using my fav product!!! I love it, although it does smear if it gets wet. This is a great product, works as advertised, and the color is wonderful. It stays on really well. I am very happy about that. It is a little dull though and makes your lips look a little dry. Other than that it was pretty good I love LA Splash lipsticks.  They last and you only need one swipe of the wand to get full coverage color.  They can feel very dry on the lips, but I don\'t mind that.\n'}]","## **LA Splash Cosmetics Soft Liquid Matte Lipstick - LIP COUTURE**

Review Text: Doesn't smell bad. I bought white and it didn't cover up my dark brown beard very well. Works nicely.  Thank you Works as advertised, but you need a lot to make your hair as white as the images they are showing as examples.<br /><br />I have short black hair, so take that into consideration, as black is difficult to get a full white coverup.<br />But when styling my hair with regular wax, I use about 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon for styling.<br /><br />To get white coverage with this wax, I need to use 3-5 times that much of this product.<br /><br />Also - it's cool to know that it's actually just zinc oxide they use for the white coloring - safe sunscreen mineral. The white product turns dark hair a shiny grey color, which is exactly what I was looking for. If you are looking to go grey and you have dark brown or black hair, I would recommend you try the white. This probably would not work on long hair. It looked awesome on the top of my hair (sides of my head are shaved with about 3 inches of hair on top). Great look for new year's parties, costume parties or just a week's worth of temporary hair changes. I would not use it long term but it's a fun short term product. It will get glitter on your pillow if you try and sleep with it in. Goes on wet; you have to use a large amount. It will dry and then you will be able to touch it, but otherwise it will get all over your hands and forehead.  The good news is it's very easy to remove with one rinse of just water, both from skin and hair. Makes your hair very stiff and somewhat difficult to style, but I made it work by slicking it back with a comb. Not exactly like the viral videos, but I got lots of compliments and had fun!<br /><br />This is just my experience with the product, please let me know if my review helped by clicking below! Love it. I have black hair with a few silver hairs at the temples, so I bought this to accentuate it. I'd planned to put s few more permanent silver streaks in my hair, but I'm happy that I bought this instead: it washes out easily if I don't quite get the effect I want. I was able to put in very natural silver streaks. The effect is subtle on darker hair, but it beautifully enhanced my gray temples.<br />The product arrived well ahead of time & was well packaged. It smells nice, and it easily washes out.<br />One caveat: it is water soluble. If you live in a hot or humid place, or you perspire easily, it could run a bit if your hair gets wet.<br />I'd definitely buy it again. I'm curious about the other colors. This product is SOLID. I got to try out what my hair would look like in the gray-ish color before actually dyeing it.<br /><br />I've wanted this color for so long, but I have a tan/beige skin complexion which a lot of lighter colors don't suit, so I was apprehensive about doing it. I got to use this product to try it out and get some opinions and now that I know that I loved it and everyone else loved it, I can dye my hair without fear. That means this product was MORE than worth it.<br /><br />Also when applying the cream, initially it makes my hair feel a bit stiff, as would any leave-in creme based products so that's not unreasonable to expect. But after a few minutes the stiff feeling was gone and my hair returned to its natural form and shape, which really allowed me to gauge how I looked with this colored hair.<br /><br />Overall this is a solid 5/5 experience and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />My hair type is long thick black hair of asian origin. I know some people have been wondering if it works on &#60;x&#62; type of hair, so I thought i would include that information. Did not come close to working in my long dirty blonde hair. Maybe if you have dark shirt hair it would be better? Does not work at all Absolutely Horrendous. (-: This is by far the worst item I have ever purchased on amazon. I was under the impression that it would make my hair look white and be easy to work with, like the photos. oh no, no no no no. it was sticky, stuck into my hair like hair gel, looked wet/greasy, and was impossible to brush in. first I did a little bit at a time with no luck, and then a lot of it. Seriously felt like i just squirted elmer's glue into my hair. it is by the far the worst product I've ever put in my hair. even after 3 washes/conditions my hair is frizzy and I have a zillion split ends. really upset!<br />Pics - after & before!

Review Text: Aeroblend is The Best airbrush foundation. It looks just like my natural skin when applied. I purchased my Aeroblend system in November, and it's Wonderful! Since November, I have tried Luminess, Belloccio, and Aeroblend foundations. I had hoped I would like Belloccio because it's half the price, but it could not compare to the Aeroblend Foundation.  The Luminess was too sticky, like it never set. The Aeroblend looks Absolutely Flawless. It takes minutes to do my makeup now, and so many people have asked me about my skin. I am so glad I purchased my Aeroblend system! I ordered this for my 16 year old granddaughter and she LOVES it. She said her makeup is sooooo awesome with this that she hates to take it off. She had a luminess airbrush and it was difficult to clean and would put dots of makeup on her face instead of a nice smooth finish. This one is amazing. Large bottle.  Great color match. Secure bottle. I'm 100% happy!<br />After reading the reviews I was excited to try this. WoW!  I purchased the Luminous kit previously & at first was excited but the bottles were small and they always leaked (in shipping & in my cabinet). This color was a perfect match for my light (not pale) skin. I use with my Luminous air system and LOVE it! This will be my go to! I was use to the small bottle, and I managed to spill the liquid twice.........if your used to the small bottles do something that you don't make the same mistake I did twice. And so much bigger than the original sample bottles I had with my machine I purchased this system and the first container was great. This one is full of lumps and will not blend. Even after shaking for almost 10 minutes.  It plugged up the tip and now I am unable to use the foundation.  Seriously disappointed. This is the lightest, most long-wearing foundation I've ever used. Period. And with mature (52) skin which tends to be dry, I'm not left with unsightly creases at the end of the day either. I use the Aeroblend airbrush to apply this in the morning and it looks great literally all day long! Despite having sensitive skin, this makeup has not caused a single breakout to date. It also doesn't feel like I'm wearing a mask - goes on light and stays that way. Highly recommend. I have never ordered this brand so I thought i’d Get it a try especially for the price of the size bottle you get.  I ordered two different colors since I wasn’t sure and this one N20 was a perfect match for my skin.  You also use less of this than the Luminess I have always purchased.  This is what I will use from now on. Great makeup but thinner than I’m used to so I had to adjust, will buy again, better price. I like to buy a very light and very dark in airbrush makeup so I can mix any shade in between. The problem with this product is it cant be back bubbled. It just created a bunch of bubbles. To mix it you have to mix in a separate container and then pour it into the airbrush. Sadly I bought a bunch of light when it was on sale around Christmas so Im stuck with it for now. Another big issue with this brand that I havent experienced with any other airbrush makeup is that it settles really bad and you have to shake it vigorously for quite a while before it mixes. I have never had a product that required this much shaking. The color is decent but tends to rub off easily. I have to be extra careful not to touch my face.

Review Text: I have bought these before. They arrived on time and work great. I can wear my heavy earrings again. These are so great. I am able to wear hoops without my earlobe looking weird. Comfortable and eases the drag on the ear lobe when earrings are heavy. I’d be lost or need plastic surgery without lobe wonders! I haven’t been able to find the brand in stores since Claire’s shut down, my earrings were pulled out years ago and I never thought I’d be able to wear earrings again, lobe wonders are durable long lasting and reliable. However I recommend if wearing a heavy earring use two of the lobe wonders, I only were one as I normally only wear diamond studs but if I must were dangling earrings I use two. Also, even if you don’t have a situation where your ear lobes are completely split they truly help hold your earrings up without putting stress on your piercings. I have bought these for years.  They are an excellent value at Amazon and work great. I LOVE THESE!!!! When I was in Jr. High (over 40 years ago) I had the hole in my pierced ear ripped & over the years it has gotten increasingly worse. I could never where stud earrings or small earrings because they would literally go through the hole in my ear until I discovered these about 6 years ago & I have used them ever since. These worked exactly as they are supposed to:) it does not work for big earrings as in the pisture it shows small earrings.tried two still did not work.stuck with the was<br />te of money don't pay to ship back,glad I bought the smaller package. They don't stick long...and they come off easily.  They are a good size and are clear.<br />They just need more adhesicivness. I have a torn earlobe ( torn all the way to the end) I wouldn't be able to wear earrings without these! If you clean the back of your earlobe with rubbing alcohol beforehand it will make these stay on for about a week, maybe two. Love this product!!!!

Review Text: So pretty Loved it was exactly what I was looking for it is easily adjustable n soft bendy material her 1st bday was a success Value for money It came with all the fake flowers smashed flat. When I tried to open the flat smashed flowers they began to fall off. I received exactly what I ordered. Beautiful flowers fits the little flower girl perfectly. Speedy shipping can’t complain all in all happy with my purchase. Bought this solely for Halloween costume carol baskin. It was a cheap one time use thing so I didn't mind wearing it for a short while when the price was great. However it is super uncomfortable with the metal wire they used so I would beware of that but overall great for short term use Very nice, for the price.<br />Had to use pins to keep in place. Simple as sweet Beautiful I used this for my daughter's birthday as her crown. She looked great in it and we got lots of compliments. It's a perfect rainbow gradient, not too bright to look totally fakey, but bright enough to see the rainbow. Each little flower is different too, which makes it look really nice.

Review Text: If you want to take a simple outfit to the next level, this is a quick and easy way to do it. They can be pinned to a jacket or blouse, and there is also a thick elastic band so that they can be added to a ponytail. They also look nice on some purses. They are stiff so they can handle storing several in one container. Some of the petals are made of a sheer fabric and others are opaque, which adds interest to the look. I have many of these in different colors, and I enjoy wearing them often. These flowers feel stiff and so they aren’t easily crushed and bent out of shape. They have a pin for wearing on clothing, and a thick, sturdy covered elastic for wearing with a ponytail.<br />I have several colors that help me add just the right amount of interest to several types of outfits. I’ve received many compliments while wearing them. Purchased to match mint colored lace shoes, necklace, earrings wore with off white sheer dress it really made the outfit got so many compliments at church. Next purchase will be to find a matching fascinator to compliment this outfit. It was pretty. Too Big for my use—Very Large—Clip and Pin fell off! Looks cheap! Happy with my purchase, exactly what I expected when ordering. Ordered for one of my daughters dresses that was very plain and it did the trick.

Review Text: I like the texture; shade and ease of using it! Excellent product, thank you. This is the best product that I have ever Used!  Great stuff!! Mirrored compact pictured in blonde tone. Received inconvenient little glass pot in what is just a regular old taupe color. It's ridiculously dark, like an ash brown. I returned it. ok Love the product. Easy on and very natural. This pomade is amazing! It came quickly and was just as pictured and described. So happy with my purchase! Sadly this version is being discontinued. This brow pomade lasts-both on the brows and in the container.  I always get compliments on my natural looking brows when I use this!

My old critique is that the front clip is not very secure. The clip never closes on my hair. It will close if it’s not gripped to anything. The ponytail still stays in place but it’s hard to achieve the pineapple look because the front piece doesn’t quite stay in place. No one could tell but I knew. Not so cute on. The pre attached bang is weird. Absolutely love it. Great Style just a lil overpriced! This ponytail too frizzy. I recommend getting the loose curls in this ponytail.

Review Text: The One Million LUCKY is my favorite scent on my husband. He ran out and I missed the smell, so I ordered more. However... One of these things is not like the other. Or rather, one of these things is like both...<br /><br />The left bottle is a genuine bottle of One Million Lucky, the center bottle is what I just received, and the right bottle is One Million.<br /><br />The bottle I just received.... Notice the one on the left has the chrome/gold front and clear glass? The one on the right has a gold front and amber glass? Hm. The one in the center has the chrome/gold front.... But amber glass??? It also smells nothing like Lucky. It definitely smells more of the regular One Million.<br /><br />I have reordered and only HOPE this is an isolated incident and I get the correct thing this next time.<br />-----<br />I rec'd the bottle I reordered today, and thankfully everything seems to be legit with it and I can resume sniffing my husband. Smells great.<br /><br />I usually use 2 squirts, with Sauvage and Chanel. With Lucky I need 3 for the staying power.<br /><br />I was worried about all the fakes online, but I took my bottle to Macys - 100% LIGIT.<br /><br />3/4 hour projection then need to reapply, reason I gave 4 Stars but I totally love this fragrance! I bought this Cologne as a Christmas Gift for my Son; He chose the type of Cologne, but of course I wanted to get a good deal and not pay Department Store prices!  I'm always worried about buying products like this online, but the Cologne seemed to be the real thing and he was very happy with it...so let's call it a good deal. Excellent perfume 100 percent authentic, fully recommended. we purchased the little one for traveling - and it is truly a great smelling mens cologne which we'd read about then ordered a tester on - then this purchase.  Give it a try you won't be disappointed. Nice! smells good A lot of complaints Smells grest Great scent.

Review Text: Good Nice material but the top button was broken off when I got it. I really like the material, easy clean, easy wash & dry. Excellent for grooming my dogs, hair slides off the material & clothes are totally protected. It easily works for men or women & the sizing is as listed. If I had one negative, I would prefer Velcro closures rather than the snaps, which are a bit tough to open & close if you have arthritis in the thumbs or hands. Otherwise, it’s a great addition to anyone who grooms animals at home but doesn’t want to be covered in hair or snag good clothing. FYI: I wear a size L/XL blouse & the grooming shirt is big on me but fits my 6’3” husband just fine. ITEM as described. But don’t use it much. I wear size 14, this wouldn't fit well enough to snap below the waist. The material is slick and not too heavy. Great fit, length and like that you can roll the sleeves and secure them. Only downfall it shows every drop of anything that gets on it. I guess it would be perfect if was black Wish is bigger size I do fit in this one but people @ Wk not The material is perfect but it's cut out with men's proportions, women need something more synched at the waist and loose on the hips...so since it was straight cut it held my hips very snug, pass. This smock is very comfortable and stylish. Keeps spray from soaking my clothes, but not completely waterproof. That would be too hot to work in. Smaller size or two than advertised, but does the job.

Review Text: Replacement for shaver. The new blades that I replaced were an inferior shave result Fine for some but I’ll stick with OEM. Sent the blades back, as the shave with the new shaver head blades was worse than what I have already on my well used shaver. The blades must not be the same length as original.  Shaves but doesn't cut as close as my old worn out original ones.  Frustrating.  That's what I get for trying to save some $ they worked better than new ones Does not seem to be sharp makes face raw Took three weeks to arrive, very generic package, just plastic, no instructions or contact info at all!<br />Cheaper isn’t always better Pure junk, Do not waste a red cent on these.

Ok Very nice blades, excited to try them out. Works well For the price this is not a bad deal. Like most reviews, the trimmers do seem to stay cooler longer than the steel. Cant really say if they cut sharper or not...seems the same to me. I will say I had trouble aligning the ceramic blades. All in all, I'll have to cut a few heads to see how they hold up over time. Just like pic. Awesome price and shaves closer than any other blade used on my outliner 2. Very satisfied with the closeness after zero gapping the blade. You can't beat the performance for the price. Got 2 so that when the first one loses its edge I have a spare.

They help to keep the screen clear of finger smudges. Since we wash our hands frequently and do not use lotion or creams when working with photos these nails stay intact for at least 4 days.  After 4 days if you are not careful or wear rubber gloves that make your hands sweat they will become loose. I have reapplied the nails by removing the adhesive pad underneath and instead applied nail glue directly to them.  These nails seem to be stronger than the ones that I purchased at the store. They look better too. I'm not into ""bling"" on nails that I wear every day. I will buy these again!

Seriously tho, it is WAY too sticky and think, ruined it for me. 😔 VERY STICKY! But the only gloss that actually lasted and didn't show lip lines😍 looove that! Decent smell as well. 10/10 Saw this gloss on a TikToker and I had to buy it!! It stays all day but it is very tacky and hard to spread on the lips. Worst lip gloss I’ve ever bought. It was so sticky and tacky! I kept in my drawer in case I changed my mind, ended up throwing it away because it’s not even worth it to keep it lying around. I think my most disappointing purchase from Amazon, besides a queen blanket I ordered that showed up as a 1x1 ft square of fabric. I like it alot it moisturizer all day keep my lip so soft it make beautiful 😍 when i turned my whole room upside down looking for this 1 tube and was going to buy it in bulk because i was devastated now it never ever leaves my side ^_^ I LOVE IT Super sticky has a nice smell but no flavor which is fine I don’t mind.

Review Text: These are a lot of fun! I ordered several. More importantly, they get the job done without problems. I get cortisone injections in my knees.  I use this little bag with ice afterwards.  Perfect. Said I was getting 3??? Only got 1?? This is the brand that I have and it doesn't leak like the others.  It is well insulated, and it stays cold for a long time.  It's also really cute!  P.S.  I just received my new one and the packaging is so nice.  And, it arrived a day early. love this so much!!! it's super cute, great size and material I love it!!! Just as advertised!!! Wish there were more graduating sizes larger with the pigs!! Not as good as one I had before that I bought in a store. This one leaks sometimes. Great small ice bag.

Review Text: We got these for a birthday party and the kids could do them on their own (ages 5-7) easily! They worked great and stayed on the entire party, even after hot tub. I recommend. These are adorable The one I received was generic video game theme-not the among us I ordered. These were for my sons Among us theme party. I did not have time to contact seller or return because I needed them right away. I still used them, but not what I wanted. Plus the plastic protection top comes off very easily. The tattoos themselves were fine, they applied easily. These were high quality. Looked great bright color These were perfect. My son absolutely adored these. The tattoos seem nice, we haven’t actually used any yet. Bought them to give out as birthday party favors. But some of the tattoos shown are not in the package, we got different ones instead. Which I’m ok with, just a heads up for anyone else. Not all the tattoos pictures were in the package. We received emergency meeting tattoos instead of the ones with the 2 crewmates and a gun. Which is ok because I wasn’t going to give those out anyway! I’ve ordered this twice now to get the pictured and described “crewmate” among us temporary tattoos for a birthday party. Both times the label is over a different “video game” label and has the wrong temp tattoos. I’m running out of time to get these right for my kid’s party. Loved these and would totally order again. Colors were so bright and the kids were able to put them on with no problem. These applied easily and stayed on! They were for a birthday party at a water park! So cute and creative. My son loves among us and loves these tattoos. I would say about 25% are not appropriate for school due to depicting violence - but its a game about killing so expected.

Review Text: According to the product label, the purpose of the Silver Miracles Colloidal Silver Foot Cream is to hydrate, lubricate, moisturize, and soothe dry skin, AND kill odor-causing bacteria. From what I can tell, it seems to do this, but not in a dramatic fashion. The ingredients include Almond Oil, Cocoa Seed Butter, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Urea, Peppermint Oil, Menthol, and Colloidal Silver. As others have pointed out, the cream spreads easy enough but doesn't seem to absorb that well into the skin. Also, the dinky-sized jar only contains 2-ounces. So, you'll probably go through the bottle fairly quickly if you follow the instructions and apply liberally. It's a decent foot cream overall but seems a little pricey for the small amount you get. I use anti-fungal cream on my feet to keep the skin moist and lubricated, and cure or prevent fungal infections including athlete foot. Silver is naturally anti-bacterial and anti-fungal, so I got this small jar (2 oz). It has a faint minty fragrance.<br /><br />You could use something like this anywhere on the body, of course, but it is quite greasy. A little goes a long way. After a shower, I apply it to my entire foot and ankle, paying attention to get it between the toes and around the nails, and then I put on clean socks.<br /><br />It’s working for me. This is great on the winter heels, I apply it at night and use my moisturizing sock and over the course of a week have found my feet become softer with less flaky dead skin, it's very moisturizing and hydrating applying after a foot bath or a shower. My heels are really dry - what I could describe as 'hoof-y' - so I use creams/treatments to keep the skin from feeling uncomfortably tight and super rough.  This foot cream is effective on making my heels feel more comfortable plus I'm using this cream on my entire feet.  This cream has a peppermint scent which I find invigorating so it's good I use this in the morning before putting on my socks.  I don't have any problem with foot odor so I cannot evaluate that.  This is a thick cream that absorbs quite quickly on my poor dry feet. I apply, wait a minute or so, and then pull on my socks as I want the cream to soak into my feet and not my socks.  My rating is 5 stars for I'm entirely happy with this foot cream, how it absorbs, and its effectiveness. [[VIDEOID:29f672525b29e6a29c81244cde21aa93]] Well packed Greasy stuff, not my cup of tea, but my wife she is OK with, so no waste here for this free for a review cream. Otherwise my wife says : IT WORKS! Returned item unopened . Ounces were small fir price . The Silver Miracles Colloidal Silver Foot Cream isn’t just for feet. The antibacterial priorities make it excellent for killing foot odor which is why it’s marketed for feet. But… also here on Amazon, you can purchase silver infused socks that last much longer than a jar of ointment to cure foot issues.<br /><br />The silver properties are excellent for first aid as well and in my opinion make better use of the ointment (based on cost effectiveness for purpose). It’s good for minor skin irritations, cuts, abrasions and especially burns.<br /><br />It came in handy initially as I managed to burn myself promptly after receiving it. It helped the burn heal much faster, while keeping infection at bay, than if I had just let nature take its course.<br /><br />I learned about the healing properties of colloidal silver about 20 years ago when my daughter burned herself as a little girl. The ER doctor sent us home with colloidal silver cream and it fixed her right up.<br /><br />I like to keep it on hand now for just such emergencies. Highly recommended. I'm very happy about its moisturizing effect. It's absorbed quickly so it doesn't make sheets or socks greasy. Nice subtle scent. Is very rich but easily absorbs into the skin without feeling too greasy. I use it just before bed and my feet feel soft and smooth the next morning.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! This jar of Colloidal Silver Foot Cream by Silver Miracles arrived with a double safety seal. A clear plastic seal outside and internally, under the lid, another seal.<br /><br />It is white and the cream is easy to use and once applied is easy to massage into the skin.<br /><br />I’m not exactly sure why this is Foot Cream, as it has many uses on the body.<br /><br />My first exposure to this type of product occurred when I needed a remedy for poison ivy. While it is not intended for that, it can help with reducing the spread of poison ivy and did seem to help mine heal faster. I did rely mostly on drying lotions like Calamine, to stop the oozing.<br /><br />You are instructed to first wash the affected area, then dry it, before applying this cream. So, it’s not really like a lot of other creams which you simply apply. I suppose you will still benefit from it if it is not washed, but the label was referencing feet, which can get really dirty. Wash hands after use.<br /><br />This is a great cream for small cuts, rashes, insect bites and burns.<br /><br />Recommended The foot cream is very moisturizing, rich and creamy.<br /><br />I read the ingredients before I ordered and was maybe expecting a nice almond scent, since almond oil was one of the first ingredients but no it smells a bit more like minty something.<br /><br />I do think the cream works very nice but the container is small and won’t last a real long time.<br /><br />I ordered to use especially in the summer time when I am wearing sandals all the time and my feet get so dry .

A clear plastic seal outside and internally, under the lid, another seal.<br /><br />It is white and the cream is easy to use and once applied is easy to massage into the skin.<br /><br />I’m not exactly sure why this is Foot Cream, as it has many uses on the body.<br /><br />My first exposure to this type of product occurred when I needed a remedy for poison ivy. While it is not intended for that, it can help with reducing the spread of poison ivy and did seem to help mine heal faster. I did rely mostly on drying lotions like Calamine, to stop the oozing.<br /><br />You are instructed to first wash the affected area, then dry it, before applying this cream. So, it’s not really like a lot of other creams which you simply apply. I suppose you will still benefit from it if it is not washed, but the label was referencing feet, which can get really dirty. Wash hands after use.<br /><br />This is a great cream for small cuts, rashes, insect bites and burns.<br /><br />Recommended The foot cream is very moisturizing, rich and creamy.<br /><br />I read the ingredients before I ordered and was maybe expecting a nice almond scent, since almond oil was one of the first ingredients but no it smells a bit more like minty something.<br /><br />I do think the cream works very nice but the container is small and won’t last a real long time.<br /><br />I ordered to use especially in the summer time when I am wearing sandals all the time and my feet get so dry .\n'}]","## Silver Miracles Colloidal Silver Foot Cream - Peppermint Scent - 2oz

Review Text: Easy to use and cleans your hair. It turns the hair color reddish brown and coarse. Does not cover the gray hair. Easy to travel with it. Okay This is my second time buying cuz it helps with hair growth and it does seem to assist with maintaining my dark hair color.  I've always used Chi hair products but now I alternate between Chi and this shampoo. The scent is clean and woodsy and it is very easy to travel with.  I wash my hair every 2 - 3 days and one shampoo bar lasts about 2 1/2 months bcuz it suds up very nice.  I think the value of the shampoo is worth it.  As a result of being sick, I experienced hair lost and everytime I washed it, a handful would fall out.  I was willing to try (almost) anything to get hair to grow. Tried this product and I started getting new growth. My hairdresser noticed the difference in thickness and how healthy my hair looked. I bought shampoo again to share with sister and daughter-in-law due to their hair thinning. And yes, I'm a real, live customer and not a paid person or robot.

Description: ['CHROM is a tooth polish, just like nail polish, that can be applied to teeth and removed in a matter of seconds, and lasts for up to 24 hours at a time. It has no taste', 'TO APPLY', '1. Mix it up. Shake the bottle hard to mix the settled pigments. If pigments are still settled after shaking, stir with a toothpick. Using the integrated brush to mix or agitate will cause unwanted fraying of the bristles.', '2. Dry teeth. Tuck cotton rolls between gums to keep mouth open. Wipe saliva off with cloth, tissue, or gauze. Teeth must be completely dry for Toothpolish to stick.', '3. Paint Toothpolish. Apply in thin layers. To avoid streaking, paint 1-3 strokes per tooth. It is important to allow at least 10 seconds dry time between layers. Polish is dry when hardened. Not dry = soft/jelly. Keep product clean. After polishing each tooth, wipe brush off on a disposable cloth or gauze before dipping it back into the bottle. Wiping brush, brush arm, and bottle edge with high-proof alcohol is also recommended.

## Easy Application Process

With CHROM Tooth Polish Uptight White, achieving a dazzling smile has never been easier. Simply follow these steps for flawless application:

1. **Mix it up**: Shake the bottle vigorously to ensure the pigments are fully mixed. If any pigments settle after shaking, use a toothpick to stir them gently.

2. **Dry teeth**: Use cotton rolls to keep your mouth open and wipe away any saliva. Dry teeth are essential for the tooth polish to adhere properly.

3. **Paint Toothpolish**: Apply the tooth polish in thin layers, using 1-3 strokes per tooth to prevent streaking. Allow each layer to dry for at least 10 seconds before applying the next. You'll know the polish is dry when it hardens.

4. **Fix it**: Use a toothpick to remove any excess polish from your gums and gaps. Practice makes perfect, so don't worry if it takes a few tries to get it just right.

Developed by dentists and made with FD&C approved ingredients, CHROM Tooth Polish Uptight White is a safe and effective way to enhance your smile. This vegan and cruelty-free product is 100% American made and gentle on most teeth. It works wonders for special occasions, photoshoots, or just when you want to feel your best.

## Remove with Ease

When it's time to remove the polish, simply chip it off using a clean fingernail or cover your finger with a cloth. For best results, remove the polish when it's completely dry. Brushing and flossing afterward will help remove any excess flakes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Is Toothpolish safe for my teeth and dental work?** Absolutely! Toothpolish is designed to be a cosmetic tooth coating that does not alter your teeth in any way—only the color. It will not harm your teeth or any permanent dental work.

Review Text: I like how it’s small and portable to bring with for travel. It’s a cute piece with man benefits and for me is how it massage to help with fine lines. Good to use with application of moisturizer. A beautiful and durable Gia Sha that makes a visible difference. Update: I have been using this for 54 days. I feel like it has really helped the circulation in my face. I feel a lot less stress in my face and I feel like my skin is happier using this. Definitely recommend.<br /><br />Got this today, it is SO nice. It comes with a visual, use and care directions. The box actually has a little magnet to keep it shut. The shape is very nice it felt like getting a facial massage. It was so soft and I can tell I'm going to enjoy using it regularly. I also love the shape of it since I am a big fan of hearts. Overall I would definitely buy this again and I may buy some for friends. I apologize my lights distorted the coloring a bit so the color is actually pinker than the photos. Beautiful and quality tool for facial gua sha. Great with oils or oil based creams. Love the rose quartz-- it makes ""Me time"" feel a little fancier. It’s work very well but it is not the same color as the photos Awesome it works just fine I use it with serum and it slides easy, first week using it I  can’t wait for my results. I have tried it for a week now and I’m pleased with my results. Cute package! Mine doesn't look like the one pictured. It's more clear, not much pink- see photo. The one pictured looks very sturdy, mine feels like fragile glass. I understand there are natural variations so I won't be returning it because I do love the use and concept. Very nice!!

Cute hair accessories, next day delivery was great. Beautiful and good quality. Even came with an extra scrunchy! My daughter and I have received so many compliments on these hair accessories.  Simple but really cute. Liven up the hairstyle. Food quality These scrunchies are so cute.  I was surprised to get a free scrunchie and the thank you not was a nice touch.  I would buy from them again. I love this hair tie. It reminds me of the 1950s sock hop look. Which I love. Will definitely buy more on diffrent colors and styles Good quality fabric. My granddaughter loves them. Very easy to use and they look amazing in my daughter’s hair! I will definitely be ordering more of these later on.

Review Text: Great product put on service trucks to store wire nuts,wire spades and other small parts no more dumping out of boxes in would buy it. Sugar scrubs leak and destroy other products with oil. Not for professional use. Easy to use. Creates a nice seal. I like the size and the qty per price but the plastic is thin.  I'm keeping my bath salts in them and if I dropped one on the bathroom tile floor I suspect highly it would crack. Love these!!! Great addition to my craft room storage!!

Review Text: I love how his product smells and the exfoliating was great. Highly recommended! I’ve used a number of different salt scrubs and love them for how soft they leave my skin feeling after a shower. This one is a little chunkier than most and feels rougher on my skin. It is also quite oily. I like some oil in my scrubs for moisturizing, often I don’t even need to apply lotion after using, but this one seemed extra oily and left the shower slippery. It separates, so needs to be shaken or stirred before using. It does leave my skin feeling smooth and provided you like coconut, the scent is nice. I like the scent of coconut but was a little worried that the scrub would feel greasy on the skin.  It was comfortable and left my skin feeling softer without feeling dry or oily.  The scrub has large salt granules and these are slow to dissolve, I like this better than a sugar scrub. This scrub smells so good, your body will be like a coconut snowcone after your use this. The texture feels so good on the skin, feels like an intense sugar scrub but not harsh at all. Really enjoyed using this and how my skin felt and smelled afterward. Review for: 100% PURE Coconut Body Scrub<br /><br />I love body scrubs and I love when they have an oil base that that helps to fight winter dryness. This one has a wonderful oil base that coats my skin and really hydrates it. It also smells fantastic. Because this is oil based, it does leave any oily film on my shower floor. I deal with this by turning my hot water all the way up and then rinsing the floor really well before getting out of the shower. This is a good body scrub that exfoliates plus moisturizes your skin.  It also smells great.  Although it contains oils, it doesn't leave your skin excessively oily once you rinse it off.  It just leaves your skin soft and smooth. This scrub works great it’s very moisturizing.The granules are on the bigger side.It has a coconut scent that dries down to a very light hint of a fragrance after awhile.The hydrating effect last long. Definitely not my favorite. I feel that it’s a bit pricey for the quality. A lot more rough than I’m used to while also being a little too oily. Didn’t like the residue it left behind in my shower floor. Smelt alright but like I said, not the best. This is a refreshing body scrub. I was pleasantly surprised with how nice it left my skin. I also enjoy the coconut scent. Overall I would recommend this product. Awesome scrub for legs makes skin feel silky smooth.
