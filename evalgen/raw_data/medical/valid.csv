[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] all right . and anything make it better or worse ?
[patient] i have been putting ice on it , uh , and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it does n't seem to help much .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?
[patient] that's right . yeah .
[doctor] okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ?
[patient] uh , afib .
[doctor] okay , and are you taking any medications for that ?
[patient] yeah , i am . um , begins with a d.
[doctor] uh , digoxin ?
[patient] that's it . yeah , that's it .
[doctor] okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] i have had a nose job .
[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?
[patient] yes , that hurts .
[doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .
[patient] that hurts a lot .
[doctor] okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time .

[doctor] okay , all right . and how about your high blood pressure ? are you monitoring your blood pressure readings at home , like i recommended ?
[patient] i'm good about it during the week while i am at home working, but on the weekends when i'm out of the house i tend to forget . uh , and so it's not as regimented , but it's been pretty good and-and under control for the most part .

[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] on your heart exam . which you've had in the past .
[patient] mm-hmm .

Annual exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression and prior lobectomy, as well as hypertension. He presents for his annual exam.

The patient reports that he is doing relatively well. Over the summer, he moved his oldest daughter into college which was a little stressful and chaotic in the heat of the summer.

Regarding his depression, he reports that he has been consistent with his Prozac and has not had any incidents in a while.

His hypertension has been slightly uncontrolled. He reports that he is taking his blood pressure at home and it is running high. The patient states that he is pretty regular with his Norvasc during the business week, but on the weekends he will forget to bring it with him.

He reports that he had a prior lobectomy a couple of years ago. He endorses shortness of breath with exertion. The patient has difficulty breathing due to allergies and the heat in the summertime. He also endorses some nasal congestion from the pollen. He reports that he runs in the morning. Occasionally, if it is relatively humid, he will struggle a little bit with breathing and he will feel a little bit of a pounding in his chest. He states that it usually goes away. He reports that he runs 4 to 5 miles a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from the pollen.
• Cardiovascular: Endorses intermittent palpitations. Endorses dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath. Endorses cough.
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Head and Face: Pain to palpation to the sinuses.
• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. No gallops or rubs. No extra heart sounds.

VITALS REVIEWED
• Blood Pressure: 124/80 mmHg.

RESULTS

Electrocardiogram stable.

X-ray of the chest is unremarkable.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ralph Barnes is a 62-year-old male who presents for his annual examination.

Annual visit.
• Additional Testing: I have ordered his routine blood work and will follow up with the patient via the portal once results are back.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well with his current regimen.
• Medical Treatment: He can continue Prozac 20 mg a day and I provided a refill of that today.

History of lobectomy.
• Medical Reasoning: I do not think we need to do any more work up for this issue. He is able to exercise a lot and his breathing function is back. I do not think he needs to follow up with the surgeon anymore.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well on his current regimen. His blood pressure was normal today and has been trending well over the past several years.
• Additional Testing: I ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate his murmur.
• Medical Treatment: He can continue Norvasc.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .

[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .

[doctor] hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .
[patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .
[doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?
[patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .
[doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?
[patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .
[doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ?
[patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .

[patient] no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .

[doctor] okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ?

[doctor] all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames .
[patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .
[doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery .
[patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?
[doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .

[patient] okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on .
[doctor] yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions .
[patient] thanks , doctor .
[doctor] diagnosis will be pituitary adenoma . mr . ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has benign appearing pituitary adenoma , incidentally discovered during workup for worsening headaches . he is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression , therefor surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated . end of note .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with a pituitary lesion. The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.

The patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.

Mr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.

The patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Newly diagnosed pituitary lesion.

FAMILY HISTORY

No known family history; adopted.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Employment Status: Works as a computer programmer.
Marital Status: Married for 25 years.
Living Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house.
Alcohol Use: None.
Tobacco Use: Non-smoker.
Recreational Drugs: None.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Patient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.

Eyes
Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.

RESULTS

Labs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.

Independent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

• Pituitary adenoma
• Bitemporal hemianopia

Mr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.

PLAN

Pituitary adenoma.
We discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.

Bitemporal hemianopia.
We will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.
• Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.

[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .
[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?
[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .
[doctor] okay . i see .
[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .
[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?
[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .
[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?
[patient] yes . with eating .
[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?
[patient] mm-hmm . i did .
[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?
[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .
[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .
[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .
[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?
[patient] they're normal .
[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?
[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .
[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?
[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .
[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?
[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .
[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?
[patient] i'd say it's about the same .
[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .
[patient] okay . good .
[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .
[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .
[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?
[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .
[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .
[patient] no . that's it . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Esophagitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.

The patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.

The patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Uterine fibroids.
Anemia.

Surgical
Cholecystectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY

None reported.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular:  Positive for chest pain.
• Gastrointestinal:  Positive for difficulty swallowing.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

RESULTS

The patient’s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient’s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.

Non-cardiac chest pain.

Suspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.

PLAN

• We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs.
• Follow up as needed."

[patient_guest] hi .
[doctor] i'm dr. evelyn , one of the kidney doctors . it's good to meet you guys .

[patient_guest] no , i have a son also who is nine . he also has autism .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and when the twins were born , katherine , she was about 4 pounds , 8 ounces . and her twin was a bit smaller , at 3 pounds , 13 ounces .
[patient_guest] katherine , she was doing fine . she just had problems with eating , where she would stop breathing when she was eating .
[doctor] like preemie type stuff ?
[patient_guest] uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient_guest] but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good .
[doctor] good . is she in therapy ?

[doctor] awesome . okay .
[patient_guest] and we also have speech therapy , who is going to be starting within the next couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient_guest] so , she has a lot of therapies . we have also seen an orthopedic and an ophthalmologist . i can never say that . we have seen everything , really .
[doctor] and audiology too , right ?
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] yeah , wow. .
[patient_guest] yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .
[doctor] okay . okay .
[patient_guest] so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .
[doctor] yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ?

[doctor] okay . great .
[patient_guest] yeah , she seems to pee a lot , and it feels like she drinks a lot too .
[doctor] that's perfect .
[patient_guest] and she used to only drink milk , and then i took her off dairy milk . so when i say milk , i actually mean , you know , ripple pea protein milk .
[doctor] sure , yeah .
[patient_guest] so i give her that milk , water now that she's used to it , and sometimes water with just a little bit of juice . so i do feel like she's drinking a lot better now .

[doctor] yeah . yeah .
[patient_guest] but she is a little bit taller than her ... um , katherine . she's just sh- a little shorter and chunkier , but i think that's a part of her syndrome .
[doctor] yeah . yeah , i was reading all the things associated with the syndrome . it sounds like we're looking for continual- congenital anomalies wi- of the kidney and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound .
[patient_guest] okay , that sounds okay .

Renal screening tests.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Katherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow’s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where “the kidneys fuse into one” and issues with their legs.

The patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates “a lot”. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow’s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism.

[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain
[patient] gosh it's like a nine
[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it
[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right
[doctor] okay
[patient] really
[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen
[patient] this happened yesterday morning
[doctor] okay
[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just not it's really bad
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry
[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally
[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just really along my wrist
[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling
[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling
[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] it does
[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[patient] yeah it does
[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[patient] not without extreme pain
[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright and then lateral as well
[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] pardon what
[patient] a what
[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[patient] when do i have to have the surgery
[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so what
[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace
[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks
[patient] six weeks
[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of
[patient] oof

[doctor] okay how long is the vacation
[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks
[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks
[patient] no vacation in a month
[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do

Right wrist injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.

The patient is going on vacation in 1 month.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right wrist pain and swelling.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 80 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute.
Body Temperature: 97.2 degrees F.
HEAD: Normocephalic
NECK: No swelling noted
CV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities.
RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
GI/GU: Non-distended
BACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity
NECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly.
MSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.

ASSESSMENT

Right wrist Colles fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.

In the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.

He adds that he avoids reaching overhead secondary to the pain. The patient describes his pain as constant and worsening. He notes his pain is unbearable when lying on his left shoulder at night. He denies any numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities. He has been taking 2 Extra Strength Tylenol every 6 to 8 hours, which provides some relief.

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin."

[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away
[doctor] right
[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products
[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally
[patient] okay where did you go
[doctor] i was in zambia
[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful
[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time
[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial
[doctor] no
[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you
[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried
[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea
[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and
[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency
[doctor] why is that
[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency
[doctor] okay okay thank you
[patient] you're welcome
[doctor] okay","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kyle Lee is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of low immunoglobulin A level. He was referred to our offices by his primary care physician after routine labs revealed abnormalities. The patient states he has been experiencing frequent infections. During the winter months, he experiences frequent colds that tend to linger, however this is not uncommon for him. The patient denies abdominal issues or diarrhea.

The patient was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He is currently taking metformin.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient denies a history of blood transfusions.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He recently traveled internationally on a trip to Zambia. His family owns a local doughnut shop.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient denies a family history of immune deficiencies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal issues or diarrhea.

VITALS

Temperature: Normal.
All other vitals were reviewed and are within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NECK: No swelling noted. No lymphadenopathy.
CV: Normal heart rhythm with no murmurs.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear. There's no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Gastrointestinal: Abdomen is soft and without tenderness.

RESULTS

I did review the results of her recent lab work. It is consistent as her primary care physician noted with an IgA deficiency.

ASSESSMENT

IgA deficiency.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that the results of his recent lab work is consistent with an IgA deficiency. I have recommended that we obtain additional blood work to check his other antibodies. I encouraged the patient to be aware of lingering infections or abdominal changes including diarrhea. If he experiences these issues, he should report them to my office so we may investigate further, however I do not believe there is a need for that at this time. In the meantime, he should report this IgA deficiency in the event that he needs any blood transfusions. Questions were invited and answered today."

[doctor] okay so the inside of your right elbow okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that
[patient] it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm
[doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything

[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities
[patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain
[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit

[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N086,"[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that
[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that
[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park
[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now
[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there
[patient] i do n't feel that right there
[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure
[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture
[doctor] correct
[patient] if i heard
[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy

Non-healing ulcer on his right foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas Gutierrez is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.

Today, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.

The patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600. He states that his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7, which has been his average for approximately 2 years. The patient checks his blood sugar 2 to 3 times per day and rarely has a blood sugar that goes over 200. He explains that he used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c that at one point was 13. He states that he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it is now.

Skin: Reports right foot ulcer with yellow foul smelling drainage, and red streaking coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle.

VITALS

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Edema and pain in calf. Bilateral palpable femoral and papiteal pulses are present. I do not recognize a palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse; however, they are present via Doppler.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: The necrotic wound on his heel is present. It is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. I do recognize the sloughing of the tissue, as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area, and erythema. An odor is present from the wound. I do not appreciate any bony exposure now. No pain to palpation in the effected area.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis or infection.

ASSESSMENT

Right non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.
Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.

In regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7. We will need to closely monitor his blood sugar since we are going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications depending on the culture results.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on his progress."

[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright
[doctor] take care bye","CHIEF COMPLAINT

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."
